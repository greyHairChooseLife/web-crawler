    biography: "Since moving to the U.S. from Saint-Petersburg (Russia), David Gukasyan (UCLA MBA '20) has been marketing EDM events at 1500 cap venues for over 10 years. In total, he's participated in over 1,000 shows featuring top-tier EDM talent. Having started as one of the grassroots promoters at Avalon Hollywood at age 19, David later made his way to a venue formerly known as CREATE Nightclub (managed at a time by SBE and Insomniac) where he became an integrated marketing manager while also booking side stages with local talents. In 2014, he moved back to Avalon as the head of marketing where he built an in-house marketing department (creative design, media buying, promotions). He also launched new side stages (Pioneer Stage, Jerry Lewis Stage) which became a new platform for local up and coming artists, with many acts becoming support DJs on the main stage. \r\n" +
      ' \r\n' +
      "Since the COVID, he has independently established a watch party community (Crewtify, Inc) for online livestreams where he brings together music fans who want to dance and have fun together while being apart via public video chats. He started this company at UCLA Anderson Venture Accelerator back in May 2020. He's currently fundraising and looking for people with different talents to join his team.",
