I absolutely love making functional pottery. There's just this amazing feeling that comes over you when you encounter that one thing that you know you are meant to do for the rest of your life. I enjoy making a ton of pottery in the spacious studio at my college, but I'll be graduating soon and I will no longer have access to their studio, so I am asking you to help me raise enough money to open my own. Eventually I want to have a studio where I can sell straight out of it, do demos, and teach others and help them develop a passion for pottery. I can't do this without you. My funds are low and My husband and I live Pay check to pay check as is, so I am heavily relying on your donations to help me make this happen!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The main problem I can see is finding a space for my studio, but in the cost I have added up it includes the price for a small building.
