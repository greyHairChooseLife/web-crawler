Each phase will therefore generate the income opportunity required to reinvest in the following phase.</p>\n\n<p>How will you raise the Phase 1 money now?\nCreating opportunities to generate direct income for the facility in a similar way to the Kickstarter reward system. Limited edition products, pottery making and pottery painting events, alongside hoc competitions. The income from which will go directly to finding each phase of the development.</p>\n\n<p>Can I still help?\nYES!! In fact to enable phase 1 WE NEED YOUR HELP. As a valued supporter of the project, you kindly backed us through the Kickstarter campaign by purchasing a reward. You will receive refund from Kickstarter for that investment. HOWEVER, the reward you purchased remains available to you, but DIRECTLY now as opposed to purchasing through the campaign.\nIf EVERYONE who backed this campaign were to get in touch directly with Saramique Studio to make that same purchase, then alongside our own personal investment (both financially and by immediately donating our own potters wheel to the new facility), this would give us the immediate ability to complete phase 1!</p>\n\n<p>What is Phase 1?\nThe repurposing and refurbishment of 2 upper floor rooms, with the addition of vital handbuilding equipment *\nPhase 1 focuses on providing the immediate ability to expand upon our current pottery programme by providing a more suitable and permanent facility to teach and host handbuilding pottery making events.\nThe addition of 1 potter‚Äôs wheel also enables a staged start to adding pottery throwing to the programme (e.g allowing for immediate one-to-one and two-to-one classes).</p>\n\n<p>Phase 2-purchase and installment of a 2nd potters wheel and relevant equipment to expand the pottery wheel programme.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 3-purchase and installment of 3rd potters wheel and relevant equipment to expand the potters wheel programme.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 4 -purchase and installment of a 4th potters wheel and relevant equipment to expand potters wheel programme. This is the point in the development that matches the original Kickstarter plans in terms of facility equipment and pottery programme provision.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 5 - this is a stand-alone phase not including or necessary to the core development. However, dependent upon the demand for the facility after phase 4 is complete, there may be necessity to move the facility to the larger room. This is introduced as a ‚Äòbells and whistles‚Äô phase...a ‚Äòstretch target‚Äô so to speak and the success of the development in itself, is not dependent upon phase 5.</p>\n\n<p>When can work start?\nIdeally work upon Phase 1 would begin in March and finish prior to the Easter school holiday period. Time scales relying solely upon current backers being willing to still go ahead with their purchase (directly to the studio) and doing so as soon as possible. Please get in touch ASAP to let us know whether you would still like to go ahead with your purchase and support a phase development of the new facility. You can email enquiries@saramiquestudio.co.uk or get in touch through our social media channels @sarmiquestudio.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much!\nSara and Si</p>","nativeImages":[{"id":"SW1hZ2UtNDEwODEx","url":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/3872180/posts/2782813/image-410811-original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=560&v=1584009757&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c88b5e7d4c398150c5ecb7257a375813","__typename":"Image"},{"id":"SW1hZ2UtNDEwODEy","url":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/3872180/posts/2782813/image-410812-original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=560&v=1584009774&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=cd1f618f3c04ae89f2e82de8b3c679c0","__typename":"Image"}],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1582938882,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI3NzAzODk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Good old Percy","publishedAt":1582938882,"pinnedAt":null,"number":12,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Sara Milthorpe","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/881/298/cdfcd702b639559157fe7387d6b3cb31_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1580167150&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=d4759a963c053e7efdc4c400d53444ad","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Working (and playing) with clay is quite captivating.
