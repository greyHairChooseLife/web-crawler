Focussing on pottery painting (painting pre-fired blank pottery) initially and providing access to facilities and experiences that for the majority, cannot be replicated at home.</p>\n<p>When we successfully approached our 3 year mark, we knew it was the right time to share more of our passion for pottery by introducing a programme of pottery making. Hand building with clay offers customers endless opportunities, and we have been wowed by the enthusiasm, progress and talent of individuals!</p>\n<p>Those fundamentals are why we believe there is huge potential in this project, even beyond this first phase...and to do this we need your backing. We would like to build a real community space that still remains useful to those who have got to a stage where classes are less important; where access to facilities, equipment and the environment to ‘play with clay’ is needed.</p>\n<p>We are proud to be shortlisted finalists - alongside some nationally recognised businesses - in the category of <span class=\"bold\">'Best local family attraction'</span>, in the Hull and East Riding Mumbler Awards 2020 (winners announced late March 2020). <a href=\"https://www.saramiquestudio.co.uk/single-post/2020/01/17/We-are-FINALISTS-How-wonderful\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out about that wonderful news here</a> in our blog &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We could tell you so much more about Saramique Studio, and the experiences we work so hard to provide...but we think it is nicer that our visitors tell you, in their own words. Please read our &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gfacebook.com/pg/saramiquestudio/reviews/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews here</a> &nbsp;and see what our customers think about their visit and experiences.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h:why-crowdfund\" class=\"page-anchor\">Why crowdfund?</h1>\n<p>We have been asked time and time again, when potter’s wheels may be coming to Saramique Studio...and we hear you! We know that your experience with clay can really be enhanced by adding wheel skills to the programme.</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-italic\">So, if demand is there then surely the income is there to move forward without Kickstarter Pledges, right?</span> Unfortunately not. Our current programme is popular and our research has given us positive direction for this project, but we have reached a ceiling in terms of current provision. A catch-22:</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-italic\">Without the facility, we cannot build the income needed to re-invest and grow it.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-italic\">Without the income to re-invest, we cannot provide the facility that is needed.</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27877643\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/877/643/00fd32927b1a53ee78aa9cdadd716fcd_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1580147745&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=0c7e6997e05bdedcd4b03c9fd2011287\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:our-own-investment\" class=\"page-anchor\">Our own investment</h1>\n<p>We want you to be totally assured that your investment is being spent wisely - that we have stretched budgets sensibly - with success in mind.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Our blood, sweat and tears</span> - aside from proven determination and sheer commitment to providing this community facility - we are taking any and all opportunity to minimise the funds required, by investing personal time and labour into this project. We are not contracting-out any works, however large or small, that we can do ourselves; keeping the target as low as we possibly can only by contracting out specialists work such as electrics or any necessary plumbing.</p>\n<p>Additionally, with every reward offered, we are again not adding to the project target with any costs of the work time involved. That's hundreds of hours invested...quite literally.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Financial reinvestment</span> – once off the ground, it will then be up to us to build upon that in terms of business expertise, financial re-investment and sheer hard work, to allow the facility to grow to its full potential.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27877559\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/877/559/a1f2bd89761c9e6d6ab1cb0ceab065c2_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1580147380&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e16242f26f6de8e5b443fd78ce3e1c5e\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"text-italic\">We rolled our sleeves up back on 2016...reinventing every inch if the lovely old building...and so we are not shy when it comes to challenging refurbishments.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"h:lets-talk-budget\" class=\"page-anchor\">Let’s talk budget</h1>\n<p>The target for our project has been considered very carefully. We recognise that it is weighted heavily by the cost of the equipment…there is no doubt that working with ceramics and the making of pottery is not a cheap hobby to have or facility to provide. However, this very factor is a core reason as to why this project is so worthwhile!</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-italic\">Those who have the skills already, those who want to develop their skills, those who are totally new to clay and want to learn new skills…providing this facility gives direct access to an experience that otherwise may not be possible.</span></p>\n<p>We have stuck to essentials in all areas, be it equipment, materials or labour – with the intention to invest in the bells and whistles, as the facility is used and the re-investment opportunity is there. We intend to self-build much of the non-electrical equipment, such as wedging tables and drying shelves. Doing all non-specialist work ourselves is our personal investment in the project…in the way we know how…time and sweat!</p>\n<p>We do however require the right tools and enough of them to get this off the ground and we are trusting in our proven determination to make a success of business, to help it grow from there.</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27877048\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/877/048/8cce78f8620fdcbd507a0218a0a658f1_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1580145261&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=de8db133928b0059a40d5e0f1c711be0\" data-airgap-id=\"33\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:the-space\" class=\"page-anchor\">The space</h1>\n<p>There are two rooms earmarked for the new facility, with 3 upper floor rooms being effected overall – an ambitious task no doubt but we are nothing if not inventive when it comes to refurbishments</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">One large room</span>, currently used for events - this will become the main workspace for teaching, events and potter’s use.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">The second room</span> is a smaller room with a sink and small cupboard area.
