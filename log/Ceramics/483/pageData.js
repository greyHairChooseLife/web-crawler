My name is Anna Myszka. I am a 25 year old college graduate with a love for ceramics and people! \r\nWhen I was a child, my family moved around a lot until we finally settled in the small city of Jacksonville. That is where I found my passion for art. I was never very good at sports or academics but it felt GREAT to finally be good at something, and that is pottery! \r\n\r\nI feel very strongly about having a career that I love and pursuing my dreams.
