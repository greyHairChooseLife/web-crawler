I do a lot of updates on social media like Facebook, Instagram and more recently e-mail blasts but then I realized not everyone gets those updates. So here's to you! Let's take a look at what's been cooking in the studio since we last spoke.</p>\n<p>It's hard to believe, but it has been just a little over a year since my project was launched and successfully funded. Since then a lot has happened. I traveled to Hungary where I learned new building techniques, spent countless hours in studio, wandered the streets of Kecskemét and Budapest observing architecture all while making incredible friends who I still stay in touch with. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"An amazing group of artists from all over the world.\" data-caption=\"An amazing group of artists from all over the world.\" data-id=\"4932952\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"An amazing group of artists from all over the world.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/932/952/b5b654176184bf7d22b333e714605ccc_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1447808887&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e5111976da9bbc02e245c431bef51ad4\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">An amazing group of artists from all over the world.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Since I've been home things haven't slowed down.

As many of you have pointed out, both my jewelry and architectural sculptures are very similar not only in the materials used but also the building methods and concepts.

What an experience being abroad for nearly two months. Thank you to those who followed my journey in Hungary via Facebook and Instagram! I just got back to Kansas City last weekend and am still getting used to the time difference.</p><p>If you were following me you'll see that I had an incredible time. For six weeks I only had to focus on three things: observing my environment (landscape and architecture), applying these ideas to my studio practice and deciding what to eat each day. ;)</p><p>But really, the importance of this trip was so I could focus on one thing: making. The first time I went to Hungary as a student in 2012 I spent the majority of my time researching, observing and trying to understand my surrounding environment and how it was constructed. I also only<i> kind of </i>worked with the porcelain. This time around I took that interest and applied it to my sculptural ceramic practice.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Behold!

I learned the technique of plaster wheel lathing to create prototypes which would later be cast in porcelain. From this finial-inspired, plaster positive I made a simple mold and cast multiples of this form in pure, Hungarian porcelain. For those who know me and my work, this was a very different way for me to create. Rather than working meticulously with strips of clay I worked with a tight, vessel-like form to explore my ideas.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Removing the plaster mold to reveal the cast, porcelain object.\" data-caption=\"Removing the plaster mold to reveal the cast, porcelain object.\" data-id=\"4102878\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Removing the plaster mold to reveal the cast, porcelain object.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/102/878/71430f6a1120461ab2aa00b1ea89640d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436208817&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5485008423a1025b982813aa52317d34\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Removing the plaster mold to reveal the cast, porcelain object.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Texture on work in progress (wip) inspired by pock marks on buildings from WWII\" data-caption=\"Texture on work in progress (wip) inspired by pock marks on buildings from WWII\" data-id=\"4098925\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Texture on work in progress (wip) inspired by pock marks on buildings from WWII\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/098/925/414c9b3d6496a7e3bff3e95a519366fb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436155110&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=60a10f4d6b5a2d3cf787e7d9e1bd1c17\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Texture on work in progress (wip) inspired by pock marks on buildings from WWII</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Work ready to be bisqued.\" data-caption=\"Work ready to be bisqued.\" data-id=\"4098931\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Work ready to be bisqued.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/098/931/a1b0d6bc00d47ff1cf354f344069adbb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436155191&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=32de98107eec37ce6452940d64202501\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Work ready to be bisqued.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> I was able to successfully bring back most of my work.
