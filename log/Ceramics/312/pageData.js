As a graduate at Concordia University, B.A Studio Arts St. Paul, Minnesota in 2009 I have yet to get behind the wheel again since graduating, sadly. Just about 10 years now. I had a couple of accidents and have had back and hip surgery. I have otherwise been busy with my little masterpiece, my son born in 2012. My dream is to make fountains, bird baths, or other functional ceramic sculpture full time to support myself and my 6 year old son. I live in artist's lofts and have access to a ceramic studio. I need a kickstart to get supplies and get going with my idea.</p>\n<p>Choose from some of these ideas or come up with something of your own. A posh cat bowl could be fun. I want to do orb style fountains but am open to your suggestions and requests. I can try to incorporate favorite animals or possibly putti.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your suggestions and requests will help me build my portfolio!</p>\n<p>I am including images of a sculpture titled \"Pretty Penny\" 2009. A ceramic penny lamp that I had made for my senior show, relief sculpture using hand building technique.</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Pretty Penny Ceramic Lamp, 2009 \" data-caption=\"Pretty Penny Ceramic Lamp, 2009 \" data-id=\"23677210\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pretty Penny Ceramic Lamp, 2009 \" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/023/677/210/63d74de81db7b756f368ec6464149304_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1546391098&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4e112a2667fe92dcf5b9483cb3851e16\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pretty Penny Ceramic Lamp, 2009 </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Pretty Penny, 2009\" data-caption=\"Pretty Penny, 2009\" data-id=\"23677265\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pretty Penny, 2009\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/023/677/265/91f5621755ad8e1426775b52b95c1fe7_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1546391694&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=263b4da7ec45ecec2ea54ab97de5ddcb\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pretty Penny, 2009</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Also including images of a sculpture titled \"I'm a Little Tea Pot\" 2009.
