By definition sacred water is not for sale, the water is a gift adding a special value to our clay vessel. I wanted to create a unique and rare offering of thanks to you for your donations incorporating the magical essence of Ireland.</p><p>“Holy Wells” in Ireland hold a unique role as symbols of the Irish culture and a connection with the natural environment. The holy well tradition is believed to date back to the pre-Christian era, they had deities and performed ceremonies at the springs. The well water itself is extremely important, particular minerals and elements have been found at a number of sites. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Saint Brigid's Well, Shanagarry, Newcastle West, Co.

Limerick</a>.&nbsp;This  well commemorates the visit of St Bridget to the area, around 500AD. Bridget moved some stones from the ground, and a well sprang up where the stones had been. \nA life-size statue of the saint has been placed beside the well. Rounds are made and a pattern is held there annually on February 1st, St Bridget’s Day which is celebrated world wide. Many visit St Bridget's temple in Kildare, Ireland on this ancient sacred day called \"Imbolic\" &nbsp;which marks the beginning of spring. St Bridget is a Celtic triple - goddess, which means that she represents the three aspects of woman: the young virgin, the nurturing mother, and the wise woman. St. Bridget protects those who call upon her. The temperature of the this Holly Well well is constant and it is believed to heal sore eyes and other ailments.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Our gifts to thank you for your generous donations\" data-caption=\"Our gifts to thank you for your generous donations\" data-id=\"4745823\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Our gifts to thank you for your generous donations\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/745/823/77a7ad360e72b72049aaaf7daf74cb30_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1445525628&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=07e8ee5ab9a08c0ddd80ebaccc59ee1d\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Our gifts to thank you for your generous donations</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I have created a range of gift items, including my handmade ceramic bottles (11cm x 6cm ) all filled with sacred water.

I'm currently living in Ireland with my son and I work along side my Father who is a ceramic artist.  I qualified as a Graphic designer and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts (honours) degree after four years of studying. Since then  I have been working very hard  establishing our family  based business, Irish Ceramic Urns. My passion for water began way before I could ever make the bottles!  I designed a collection of sacred vessels inspired by my love, interest and fascination with the use of sacred water throughout Ireland's history. There are hundreds of holy wells scattered throughout Ireland's landscape, regularly maintained and still used by locals. The water rituals and the holy sites are something to behold and a visit would be encouraged to all. It is a thrilling adventure in locating and finding the Holy Wells, similar to a treasure hunt there are stories of legend and hidden trinkets to be discovered. I am currently putting together a map so that visitors to Ireland can locate the wells for themselves. Please contact me if you would like more information or a guide if you are ever in Ireland and fancy an adventure to find Ireland's sacred treasure. xxx","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Keri Shannon Sherlock","creator_last_login":1653656724,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":6,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.irishceramicurns.com","domain":"irishceramicurns.com"},{"url":"http://www.irelandssacredwater.com/","domain":"irelandssacredwater.com"},{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/sacredireland/?ref=bookmarks","domain":"facebook.com"},{"url":"https://www.etsy.com/ie/shop/SacredIreland","domain":"etsy.com"},{"url":"http://irelandssacredwater.blogspot.ie/","domain":"irelandssacredwater.blogspot.ie"},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/113058664856338000274","domain":"plus.google.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/010/117/744/7b3b65fdd7d2507dfb31e43814abc991_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461668411&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=dc371e875b14a8e0338743af93f6b958","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/irelandssacredwater","top_cities_location_1st":"Dublin Ireland","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"2","top_cities_location_2st":"Oshawa Canada","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_cities_location_3st":"Hastings United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_cities_location_4st":"Cork Ireland","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_cities_location_5st":"Lippstadt Germany","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_cities_location_6st":"Milan Italy","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Leidschendam Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Barcelona Spain","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Brisbane Australia","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Sydney Australia","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"11","top_countries_location_2st":"Ireland","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"3","top_countries_location_3st":"Australia","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"2","top_countries_location_4st":"Canada","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_countries_location_5st":"Germany","top_countries_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_countries_location_6st":"Italy","top_countries_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_countries_location_7st":"Netherlands","top_countries_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_countries_location_8st":"Philippines","top_countries_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_countries_location_9st":"Spain","top_countries_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_countries_location_10st":"United Kingdom","top_countries_number_of_backers_10st":"1","number_of_new_backers":5,"number_of_returning_backers":19}
