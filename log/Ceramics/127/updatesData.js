You can find a special place for it if you would like, or place your crystals, incense or herbs around it… The important part is just to get the water outside under the light of the moon.

I took a walk there with my partner Saturday last, on the brightest day we have had for a little while. Ireland is known for is wet weather and its diverse rain but when the sun is shining Ireland's bright colours are relieved and all her rainbows come out of hiding. </p><p>As we approached the site I was delighted to see in the distance a small purple ribbon tied to a tree next to the well. I was really hoping to show you this tradition but hadn't seen a rag tied there for a while so I couldn't take a photo. The rag tying is a tradition linked to the Holy Wells. Its believed that after wetting a cloth or rag in the well water it is placed onto an area that needs healing, the rag is then tied to a near by tree branch. As the rag rots away so does the illness. My partner suggested that I tie one there myself, but not only am I, thankfully, in good health, I really want everything to be as authentic as possible, and with St Bridget watching over me I think that telling lies wouldn't be such a good idea :) </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The rag tying tradition with a handmade St Bridget's cross annually made.\" data-caption=\"The rag tying tradition with a handmade St Bridget's cross annually made.\" data-id=\"4878241\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The rag tying tradition with a handmade St Bridget's cross annually made.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/878/241/8197e06061c14e05a2459c4298cf4bcc_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1447156815&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=fe34cbb80d8cbdc580775e4df2476fa5\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The rag tying tradition with a handmade St Bridget's cross annually made.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> Also as you can imagine I was even more thrilled to see the cross hung next to the ribbon. These crosses are made annually to celebrate St. Bridget. The 1st of February  is a Holy day in Ireland it is also ancient as its marks the start of Celtic spring celebrating the arrival of longer, warmer days.</p><p>I moved into a new house recently and I was given one of these crosses by a new neighbour as a welcoming gift. At the time I thought is was a sweet thing to give but it isn't really until now, as I'm thinking about it, that am realising  its quite a significant gift to give me :) and I moved into the house also on the 1st of February :)</p><p>hmmm, where was I,,,,, oh yes, collecting water.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"I used my own container but there is a cup next to the well if you fancy a sip....\" data-caption=\"I used my own container but there is a cup next to the well if you fancy a sip....\" data-id=\"4878346\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"I used my own container but there is a cup next to the well if you fancy a sip....\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/878/346/53ade6b86086be5b9d699064f9c938d8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1447158382&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1048766d7f8f0b921961a158780ca48b\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">I used my own container but there is a cup next to the well if you fancy a sip....</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The water is so clear and isn't as cold as you might think.\" data-caption=\"The water is so clear and isn't as cold as you might think.\" data-id=\"4878354\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The water is so clear and isn't as cold as you might think.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/878/354/ce5811a6107f3c66e03b7b7c5e0e6ab0_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1447158461&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=020cfe3e648dea762e6ec24cc21d630a\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The water is so clear and isn't as cold as you might think.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4878373\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/878/373/04ed1f8ffb3ea3d8a5e74e3f7db7e9a1_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1447158581&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d8b5e766a982e8a58c903e272c47dd8e\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have to add the image of the cup left next to the Well for people to use.

Easter is a Holy holiday celebrating the rebirth of Jesus and marks the end of lent, we celebrate this by eating, reviving and giving chocolate eggs!!!.... see....its actually the perfect mug for the well even though it doesn't, at first, seem to fit :)</p><p>I also have to mention that Kris, my partner threw a coin into the well! I don't know what he was thinking, he must have thought it similar to a wishing well, yet he didn't notice that there were no other coins :? I demanded that he dive back into the water and retrieve that coin before it contaminated the water - the coin and his arm were washed well (tee hee) and returned to their rightful place - we found the perfect place for the coin.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Giving a donation to Bridget for the water.\" data-caption=\"Giving a donation to Bridget for the water.\" data-id=\"4881914\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Giving a donation to Bridget for the water.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/881/914/b66dc31719d5690d84226d016f1e4fad_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1447184670&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ca4a89b99cf0dbd0471b8e14390b9885\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Giving a donation to Bridget for the water.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> I imagine that donations to the Well help maintain the beautiful grounds and the general up-keep of the area.
