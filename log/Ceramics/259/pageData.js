My name is Quinten, </span>I would like your help creating a porcelain mug with my artwork on it.</p>\n<p>I am a nine-year-old boy from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. My passions are drawing and sciences. I almost know the entire periodic table by heart and I give lectures in my class about mathematics and physics. When I grow older, I want to become an inventor. I am worried about the world’s use of fossil fuels and would like to invent alternative energy sources.</p>\n<p>When the world around me gets too busy, I love to go to my room and draw. When I draw, I can completely focus. About 6 months ago I started drawing with new techniques in my art class at school:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27308478\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/308/478/57ec7cfab0799333f9ddb35b534045da_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574445735&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=27c77077acba068af13369b007307d3b\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Since then I am experimenting with finer lines and 3D effects, and I have made many new drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27305633\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/305/633/473fea22aca58828dad4f407942ede7b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574427485&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=702b4c79d19939495033006a4e1a7097\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">From Quinten’s parents</span></p>\n<p>Quinten has autism. The last 6 years have revolved almost entirely around accepting his diagnosis, getting the right help and finding a way to adjust to the many challenges as a family.</p>\n<p>A couple of months ago we were suddenly approached by several people who were interested to buy Quinten’s drawings. As you can imagine we were completely taken aback by these requests!</p>\n<p>When we asked Quinten if he would be interested in selling his art, he was very adamant: ‘No’. He said he was glad to hear people liked his art, but he said they didn’t realize how long it took to make each drawing. He said he could not part with his ‘originals’. Of course, we understood and told the people interested that his drawings were not for sale.</p>\n<p>Then we had an inkling. What if we would have his artwork printed on something? Then Quinten could keep his originals and people would still be able to enjoy his artwork.</p>\n<p>We started a quest on what would be the best first item to print his artwork on. It should be long-lasting, something you use every day so you can look at the artwork daily and something that looks beautiful in its own right. We also were looking for something that reflects his roots.</p>\n<p>It took us a little while to figure this out, but then we suddenly knew it! Quinten loves drinking tea from his mom’s tea mug. It was going to be a porcelain tea mug. Holland has a long tradition of Delft Blue porcelain. And centuries ago in the Golden Age the Dutch traded highly valued Chinese porcelain.</p>\n<p>After doing some research we found out that there no longer is a porcelain industry in The Netherlands. Nowadays, all the high-quality porcelain is produced in China. So, we found the highest quality porcelain producer in China. We contacted them if they would be willing to work with us on this special project. They loved the project and said ‘yes’😊.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"The people in the porcelain factory in China who are helping us with this project\" data-id=\"27305644\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/305/644/4c92a491b3b980bcfa3c96983b6fc02a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574427575&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=3843fc6738c711f4a621af506ecfa599\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The people in the porcelain factory in China who are helping us with this project</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago we’ve had the first sample made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27305663\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/305/663/7d0242b27db204f609425c8486dfb26d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574427803&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b1ed22f24907f7a289de64880b9f25f0\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>When Quinten saw the sample coming out of the box, he couldn’t believe his artwork was printed on this mug! He was beaming with pride. It was so heartwarming to see his reaction.</p>\n<p>As parents, the reasons we are setting up this project is to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>show Quinten the positive side of his autism</li>\n  <li>help Quinten with his self-confidence</li>\n  <li>learn how his talents can help him to be self-sustainable and become a contributing member of society</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also hope that this project can:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>bring awareness to the beautiful talents that children with autism can have</li>\n  <li>be an inspiration for children with autism and their families</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you feel inspired by the story of Quinten, who uses drawing to escape from the world and who’s drawings are bringing the world closer to him at the same time? Would you like to drink your tea out of a beautiful porcelain mug, while enjoying Quinten’s artwork? &nbsp;Then become a backer (by choosing one of the rewards on the right) and give this project a kickstart!</p>\n<p>Note that this project will not continue if we do not reach the threshold so we can really use your help in passing on the message through your friends and social media!</p>\n<p>We realize this special edition mug would be a perfect Xmas gift. If you become a backer we'll send you a message containing a link where you can download a beautifully designed voucher, which you can frame and give as a Xmas present.</p>\n<p>This mug will be Quinten’s very first product. With your pledges we will start producing this mug. If there are more pledges than needed to cover the costs we will use the remainder to build a platform where Quinten and other children with autism can showcase their art to the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27322061\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/322/061/fce45b480a258d28c43ddcc6f20a0ef1_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574585233&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=abc67f4f02d583f38eb613390750a5fa\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27322050\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/322/050/8d3b037779a5a1bd30b1d4caed08dedd_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574585171&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=cb2ef6fc528db50da7fcb448cc2302fc\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27322066\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/322/066/b56184625eb5b7f8b8fa646dbc080dfb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574585283&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=929131f001b18af449e99535e34bc215\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">This project is new and has both artistic and operational challenges. One of the artistic challenges was that we weren’t sure if Quinten’s artwork would look good on a mug. Therefore, we had a sample made to check the design and quality of the porcelain. A quality controller in China will oversee the entire production process. \n\nThe biggest risks we see at the moment is that we don’t reach the threshold. The minimum order quantity is 1,000 mugs, so our threshold is relatively high. Other operational challenges are breakage during transport and not being able to know the exact delivery date. \n\nThe factory has assured us they know exactly how to pack the mugs to prevent any breakage. \nAs for the delivery date - we are dependent on the factory production and shipping schedules, so can’t yet pinpoint the exact date, but it will be somewhere early in Q1 2020. \n\nWe have a lot of experience in operations and fulfillment so backers can rest assured we will leave no stone unturned in making this project into a success.

My name is Quinten. I am a nine-year-old boy from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. My passions are drawing and sciences. I almost know the entire periodic table by heart and I give lectures in my class about drawing roots and exponents. When I grow older, I want to become an inventor. I am worried about the world’s use of fossil fuels and would like to invent alternative energy sources. \r\n\r\nWhen the world around me gets too busy, I love to go to my room and draw. When I draw, I can completely focus and I am not bothered by sounds.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Jantien Aerts","creator_last_login":1631029784,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://quinten-art.com","domain":"quinten-art.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/201/370/9bb45615557ad6146d1d33b48ea336ec_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1573658030&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=5c98839536071fb21f73b0ce262ee14a","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/quinten-art","top_cities_location_1st":"Amsterdam Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"54","top_cities_location_2st":"Utrecht Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"8","top_cities_location_3st":"Rotterdam Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"7","top_cities_location_4st":"London United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"4","top_cities_location_5st":"Helsinki Finland","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"3","top_cities_location_6st":"Almere Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"2","top_cities_location_7st":"Amstelveen Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"2","top_cities_location_8st":"Delft Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"2","top_cities_location_9st":"Eindhoven Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"2","top_cities_location_10st":"Groningen Netherlands","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"2","top_countries_location_1st":"Netherlands","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"118","top_countries_location_2st":"United Kingdom","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"7","top_countries_location_3st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"7","top_countries_location_4st":"Finland","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"3","top_countries_location_5st":"Germany","top_countries_number_of_backers_5st":"2","top_countries_location_6st":"Italy","top_countries_number_of_backers_6st":"2","top_countries_location_7st":"Singapore","top_countries_number_of_backers_7st":"2","top_countries_location_8st":"Australia","top_countries_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_countries_location_9st":"Belgium","top_countries_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_countries_location_10st":"Canada","top_countries_number_of_backers_10st":"1","number_of_new_backers":116,"number_of_returning_backers":50}
