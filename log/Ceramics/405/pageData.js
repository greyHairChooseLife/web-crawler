I have been shipping products out locally on a small basis for about a year now and have a system in place that will coordinate that.  I understand that as the popularity increases that I will have to tweak that system to effectively work with a larger demand.\n\nTo ensure the products are not only the correct color, and have the correct name on them and are shipped to the correct person, I will email each person who supports the project a note that verifies their contact information and what they purchased, at that time they will select the color of the product and indicate the name/names that are to be embossed on the product.  Once I have that information and the product is put into in the production schedule, I will then email them a realistic timeline informing them of when to they can expect their products.  In general, the products will be made in the order that the pledges here made, provided the color selection and naming information is promptly emailed back.\n\nThis is my first campaign, so if the interest is greater than I expect, I’m sure I will have issues to work out with production, sorting, shipping and everything else.  I promise that as issues arise that they are evaluated, and adjustments are made immediately.  Feel free to send me any questions or concerns that you have. \n\nDue to the personalized natural of the handcrafted products, refunds are not allowed. However, occasionally items are damaged during the shipping and transit process, and other unforeseen things happen.
