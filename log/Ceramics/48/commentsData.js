I had the most amazing opportunity to be the only student in her very first class teaching at an art center in Virginia. I'm still grateful for that -- and not only for all the technical things she taught me over several more classes but for her attitude of adventure, exploration and enthusiasm for all aspects of ceramics. I am thrilled that she wants to bring her passion for teaching to her community. I have absolute faith that she will pull this off, and I'm excited to support this awesome project.","createdAt":1628469591,"author":{"id":"VXNlci04NTIxNTg0Mzg=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=38b545eeac1249d5d25c87db69d5ee12","name":"Terri J Huck","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/852158438"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0zMzY5MTAxNQ==","body":"I've worked with Deb for 11ish years now... wow, that long! I know her to be dedicated, educated, and passionate about creativity.  If anyone can pull this off and have it be wildly successful, it's her. It's rare to find someone who goes above and beyond because they care. When you do find them, you want to support them. That's why I contributed. Support what you love in life.","createdAt":1628451924,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0yOTI4MjY2NDA=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/931/680/deed603d1f212f1ff2456f524aac2273_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1461115498&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c1c590b93a38cbcc4148f3a4892f180c","name":"Wendy Anderson","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/292826640"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0zMzY4MjEyNw==","body":"Art saved my life. I am an active duty service member and I went through a very difficult time in 2017. I started doing art therapy which somehow led me to a local center where Deb worked. She walked me through every step of preparing a piece for display in a gallery, helped me apply and gave me the confidence to show my art to the world. It made a huge difference in my life. Since then, she's helped me continue to grow in my clay journey and I've been able to take many classes. These classes are a huge part of my mental health self-care. Deb: I can't wait to see what you do with this space and I can't wait to drive down 95 to Stafford and join you in a class!!","createdAt":1628336855,"author":{"id":"VXNlci04Nzg5MDUxMTM=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=38b545eeac1249d5d25c87db69d5ee12","name":"Valerie Acosta","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/878905113"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}}]
