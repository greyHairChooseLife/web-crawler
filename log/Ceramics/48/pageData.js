I have also been creating sculptural artwork, exhibiting internationally for many years but, the idea of functional pottery was something I only recently realized as a passion. So to see people enjoying my pottery, day-to-day, brought me so much joy that I knew I might have something here. I decided to go <span class=\"bold\">FULL IN </span>and try to create pots that make people's days better.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Approaching this with a business mindset, I started reaching out to local businesses here in Stafford, VA on the off chance they may want to partner with me and never looked back!</p>\n<p>That decision changed everything!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"34034051\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/034/034/051/e44e4b1304e27dc32af73c1783574906_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1624890039&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=54a801d9c1dda737dc2ba9f7aa0e7e8b\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>For instance, after visiting Barley Naked Brewing Company off route 610 on a whim one day, I met Barry and Missy (Owners of Barley Naked) and we chatted about beer mugs, I gave them a business card, and the rest is history!

Stafford is that \"in-between\" county, under Woodbridge and above Fredericksburg that often get's overlooked. But the business-owners here have so much heart and a true desire to create a sense of community. We're the little guys, and we take care of our own. &nbsp;This is an opportunity to create a destination in your backyard that will also help improve our local economy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What does this all mean?- <span class=\"bold\">STAFFORD NEEDS A CREATIVE</span> <span class=\"bold\">SPACE FOR ALL.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<p>This campaign is meant to help me develop a <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">physical creative</span></span> <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">space</span></span> to share with this community, where <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">YOU </span></span>can come and take classes, learn something new, be creative, and enjoy working alongside your community members.&nbsp;I am turning my semi-professional home studio into an entirely professional and public-facing actual art center operation, and I am asking you to help me make that happen.</p>\n<p>No matter what, Corgi Clay will continue to do what we do, but I know I would be able to serve more community members, better, if we had a dedicated space that was bigger and better equipped to handle the interest. &nbsp;I have always dreamed of establishing a fully professional creative space that I could operate publicly, to help realize other artists' creative goals as well as my own. SO now is my chance.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Your donation will help <span class=\"text-italic\">Kickstart </span>this amazing idea.

With this new creative space I commit to offer all of the following to YOU:</p>\n<br>\n<p>A. Arts educational experiences, with a focus in ceramics, for ages 5 through adult on multiple days of the week for maximum customer schedule flexibility. Classes, workshops, art talks, demonstrations and more, executed at a physical location/classroom and online through social platforms. Open Studio access offered during non-class-hours will also allow students to return several days a week to continue working and developing their skills.</p>\n<p>B. Visual Arts Residencies where Visual Artists are juried into a small studio spaces to work on their own craft. Resident Visual Artists are considered “Working Artists” for the Center and once juried, will have duties beyond artmaking as part of the residency.</p>\n<p>C. A gallery/shop showcasing and selling the artwork of the Visual Artist Residents and Owner. This gallery will also host visiting exhibitions from outside artists to broaden Corgi Clay Arts Center’s regional footprint.</p>\n<br>\n<p>ALSO- there is a simple truth that has to be considered...

But as I said, Corgi Clay will continue to operate, offer classes, and make artwork for all!\n\nThe major challenge of this project is that I am all-in so, I am leaving one of my full-time jobs to pursue this 100%. Also, amid this global pandemic still affecting us all, keeping my personal bills paid and attracting students to take classes with me in a small studio, while I get things up to speed here poses a formidable challenge.\n\nIt's not just money issues that are a challenge now in light of the pandemic, but also time. It will take time to assemble all the materials and equipment, assuming there are no delays due to social distancing and businesses being shut down. It will take time and labor before the studio can be up and running according to my vision – and it will take time before people feel personally safe to re-enter the world beyond their own spaces. These are variables that I can't predict or control, but I wouldn't be attempting this if I didn't already feel and know that there is support out there for this to happen.\n\n\nNo risk, no reward!
