1966, and at the age of 88, she continues to teach, inspire and creatively stimulate her students almost fifty years later!&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Jean's pending Golden Jubilee</span>&nbsp;has inspired us to self-publish a monograph of her ceramic artistry.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">This book</span> will contain sumptuous photographs of Jean's work, along with sketches of her unique \"painting with glazes\" process and concepts, interviews, and quotations.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">As students</span> of Jean's, we are committing our energy to organize and produce this book as a labor of love. We ask for your financial assistance to fund the professional photography and design services necessary for book publication. Jean is both touched and exhilarated at the prospect that her artistry will be documented and travel beyond the Community Center ceramics studio.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">To celebrate</span> this moment in Jean's career, you will be invited to a party in <span class=\"bold\">May 2015</span>, after the monograph is published&nbsp;... but we need your help to make this project a reality!&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Donations</span> at any level are welcome and are a meaningful contribution to this goal!&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Our sincere thanks for your consideration</span>,</p><p>Ines Chessum, Allison Goodman &amp; Georgie Kajer</p><p>(Architect, Graphic Designer, Architect...&amp; all students of Jean's!)</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">We foresee very little risk since we believe we have the professional skills and resources to self-publish a book that reflects both Jean's artistic sense and standard of quality.\r\n\r\nWe feel confident that we can publish Jean's book by April 30th.  Our challenge is to know that we have met our financial goal in order to move forward with the collaboration with our photographer and book designer. With funds committed, we want to complete the book design and have it ready for publication through Blurb.com as soon as possible.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMzA2MzQ0NzY5","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":4,"number_of_comments_depth_all":0,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nProduce a book about the artistry of Helen Jean Taylor, ceramicist and instructor extraordinaire.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/017/707/e1c4d11a7337c0407326f0e2cffee14e_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463724447&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=0da9d984ff13f76090f89aa3428fd7d0","last_updated":"June 10, 2015","project_name":"he Artistry of Helen Jean Taylo","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"7,000","amount_of_pledged":"8,160","number_of_backers":"65","rate_of_funded":116,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"La Canada Flintridge, CA","creator_name":"Georgie Kajer","creator_location":"La Canada Flintridge, CA","creator_description":"I am a practicing licensed architect in La Canada Flintridge, and my project colleagues are Ines Chessum, Architect (residential architect in the US and Mexico) and Allison Goodman, Professor of Graphic Design at The Art Center College of Design. \r\n\r\nTogether, we represent the passion and ability to be successful stewards of your donations to this project for Jean.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Georgie Kajer","creator_last_login":1477860628,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.kajerarchitects.com","domain":"kajerarchitects.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/508/438/6947f13bbffe9f00d45ddc0a89637a57_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461599901&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=199fcc805d9c206ec26fa2e0177553fe","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/jeantaylorbook","top_cities_location_1st":"Pasadena United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"11","top_cities_location_2st":"Glendale United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"10","top_cities_location_3st":"Altadena United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"5","top_cities_location_4st":"Los Angeles United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"5","top_cities_location_5st":"Anaheim United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"2","top_cities_location_6st":"La Canada Flintridge United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"2","top_cities_location_7st":"Long Beach United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"2","top_cities_location_8st":"San Francisco United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"2","top_cities_location_9st":"Morelia Mexico","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Sydney Australia","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"62","top_countries_location_2st":"Australia","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_countries_location_3st":"Mexico","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","number_of_new_backers":53,"number_of_returning_backers":12}
