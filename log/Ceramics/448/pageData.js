Croydon is a borough of London, located in the south. The mosaic itself is situated opposite a pub, within Croydon's corporate quarter, with some residential flats near by. The place primarily serves as a place for office workers&nbsp;to smoke and eat their lunch, but also contributes to the slowly reducing array of, long standing, free art pieces accessible to all. With the UK the national government's tax service moving in down the road also. This area is no stranger to footfall. &nbsp;http://www.drostle.com/portfolio/fishpond/\n \n </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Current State\" data-caption=\"Current State\" data-id=\"14495070\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Current State\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/495/070/981e61bbce26156f129bb4ac24109912_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1479042784&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b2a9a0eeafb508bbcdaac5ec2253d8bf\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Current State</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/sad-state-mosaic-left-fall-apart-borough/story-20906852-detail/story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Taken myself spring 2016\" data-caption=\"Taken myself spring 2016\" data-id=\"14414411\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Taken myself spring 2016\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/414/411/786324a64875cddaf72add042af46320_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478468088&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e02a77440c6128136e4bff24be4b1376\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Taken myself spring 2016</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:\" class=\"page-anchor\">&nbsp;</h1>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Taken October 2015\" data-caption=\"Taken October 2015\" data-id=\"14416361\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Taken October 2015\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/416/361/3a96fa6a5af6d05ecba6588f93f4da96_original.PNG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478482680&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b1aedbdee7e4e579ec8c389bc7d7ab16\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Taken October 2015</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Taken Summer 2016\" data-caption=\"Taken Summer 2016\" data-id=\"14416371\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Taken Summer 2016\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/416/371/ff8cfdae32398cb0bcf6a203fdfa0fa8_original.PNG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478482848&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=cd820d03a45a600121bc636abd09863a\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Taken Summer 2016</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div><br></div>\n<h1 id=\"h:kickstarter-project\" class=\"page-anchor\">Kickstarter Project</h1>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><p>This kickstarter will be used to commission artist Gary Drostle to remake or restore this piece.

Home of the Brit School: an incubator to acts such as Amy Winehouse, Adele, The Kooks, the new SpiderMan and many others. Croydon is no stranger to art. Unfortunately, highlighted ironically by a lack of a yearly council led Ambition Festival, Croydon Council &nbsp;are mostly unwilling to invest in the preservation or nurturing of such creative cultural spaces. Though it must be said, Croydon did have some great collaborative festivals this summer.</p><h1 id=\"h:sad-state-of-award-w\" class=\"page-anchor\"><a href=\"http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/sad-state-mosaic-left-fall-apart-borough/story-20906852-detail/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sad state of award-winning Croydon mosaics left to rot &nbsp;</a></h1><p>from Croydon Advertiser - 2014</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Original look\" data-caption=\"Original look\" data-id=\"14416274\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Original look\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/416/274/c809461262e1f65826135c73bb26556a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478481997&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9cd374cdd6c9e12d6b3de62268b1b69f\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Original look</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>AS A strikingly realistic depiction of fishes swimming happily in a pond, made from thousands of tiny ceramic pieces, it has drawn admirers around the world.\n\nBut anyone hoping today to see the trompe l'oeil Fishpond Mosaic, installed in 1996 at the corner of Bedford Park and Sydenham Road, will be sorely disappointed.\n\nNearly half the pieces making the 2m-wide piece of public art have been dislodged or have disappeared – after, its creator says, the council failed to stump up for relatively simple repairs.\n\n<span class=\"bold\">Shown a photo on Tuesday of his disintegrating artwork, its maker Gary Drostle, seeing the piece for the first time in years, said: \"It is a shame. It did not have to be like that.\"\n\nThe renowned mosaic artist was commissioned by Croydon Council to create the piece in 1996</span>, as part of improvements to the area just east of Wellesley Road in the town centre.<span class=\"bold\">\n\n\"It was an area where people could sit and eat their sandwiches and stuff and look on the mosaic,\"</span> he said.\n\n\"I had done a some other projects in the borough that had been quite successful.\"\n\nHe spent roughly two months creating the piece in his studio, at the time in Greenwich, before placing it on site.<span class=\"bold\">\n\nThe work won a Croydon Design Award in 1997 and International Mosaic of the Year in 2002, and remains revered by mosaic artists and designers.</span>\n\nMr Drostle claims that, more than five years ago, he received a call from the council asking him to repair the piece because it had been damaged by falling scaffolding.\n&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">He responded with a quote for roughly £600, but never heard anything back.</span> The piece is now barely recognisable, surrounded by tufts of grass and, on Tuesday, topped by a discarded Pepsi cup.\n\n\"It is a common problem with public art: all the money goes to making it and no thought to maintenance,\" Mr Drostle said.\n\nBut, he added, damage of this sort was not inevitable, and would have most likely been started by the puncture.\n\nHe said: \"They are pretty tough; the ceramic it is made of is incredibly strong.\n\n\"People walking on it or even cars driving across it won't (do this).\n\n\"But once you have got a hole in the mosaic it allows the water to start getting underneath and things start getting chipped.\"\n\nThe artist's other work includes the landmark 7.5m-high De Luci Mosaic sculpture in Kent and the Roots, Routes, Roots community mosaic under the railway bridge in Portland Road, South Norwood.\n\n<span class=\"bold\">Mr Drostle said he would be very happy to remake the fish mosaic, which would probably now cost about £8,500.\n\nThe piece marked the first time he had been given no brief other than the size of the work.\n\n\"It is still the most popular one that everyone comments on,\"</span> he added.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:tiers\" class=\"page-anchor\">Tiers</h1><p>While the idea has been lingering in my head over the weekend before starting this.

The original artist refuses to restore the piece, the next step would be to ask for him to redraw the plans and have a third party finish it. If Gary Drostle is unwilling to help towards the restoration or plans without the Council's blessing. The Kick-starter will be cancelled.\r\n\r\n2. There is an article by Croydon Advertiser article of a New World Associates offering to replace the mosaic with something new. \r\nhttp://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/damaged-award-winning-croydon-mosaic-replaced-new/story-26714519-detail/story.html\r\n\r\nThis company has now dissolved, so this action seems unlikely (but is not impossible).\r\nhttps://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09128390/filing-history\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Council actively try to prevent the restoration.  While the article linked mentions Croydon Council have agreed in principle for the mosaic's replacement by this defunct company. Contact with relevant parties in the council are already trying to be established. Should the council rescind this agreement, the kickstarter will be cancelled. This will be treated as a type of guerrilla, subversive project.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":3,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">£10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 12</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nBasic Pledge\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A plaque or sign will be attached beside the mosaic, either on a bench, the floor or on the grass.
