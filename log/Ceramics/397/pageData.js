My name is Vladimir, I am an artist. I have been working with ceramic and have my own a ceramic workshop. From the childhood, I have always wanted to craft, to create something different, to find my place in the world of art and produce beautiful pieces. I believe that as an artist I must be able to find beauty in ordinary life and present it in my work.\nMy father who is also an artist always says we should retain inner little child to be able to create; refrain from become a cynic and then you will be able to find your inspiration.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Material\n&nbsp;</span></p><p>The lamp is designed as a little house made of chamotte clay. (Chamotte is also known as grog and firesand).\nChamotte clay is a heat resistant material with superb structural strength. I like to work with it because of its “rustic” texture and special beauty. This kind of clay is extremely well behaved, plastic and resilient. Albeit it contains almost twenty ingredients, all of them are natural – no toxic or artificial chemicals added; grogged clay is known as an eco-friendly pottery material. \nA custom-made cast is filled with chamotte clay, and fine finishing by hand is required to fix any surface ornament faults. Further, a ware has to dry – it takes time as it dries naturally to prevent deformation and retain strength.\nAfter that it is fired in oven at 1000 degrees Celsius, or 1830 degrees Fahrenheit., and becomes light and gets its crisp texture.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"22322130\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/322/130/8ef3272e0ddf7000f585ff27ec013fee_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1535028685&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1aba421b7444669cd2f5035688cae0b0\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Majolica</span>\n&nbsp;</p><p>In my opinion, majolica technology is one of the best ways to fill earthenware with vivid and rich colours.\n\nMajolica, or tin-glazed earthenware, is a celebrated art form that is highly regarded by art lovers and collectors. The word “Majolica” has Italian origin – although it was introduced into Italy from Moorish Spain by way of the island of Majorca, or Maiolica, whence it derived the name by which it was known in Italy.  However Majolica technique was improved by Spanish, French, Dutch and Slovak artisans. Majolica pottery is typically an earthenware covered in glaze containing tin oxide which is white, shiny and opaque. Knowledge of different pottery materials and application of laws of physics to firing and decoration processes help to produce beautiful majolica masterpieces. \nAnd then I apply glaze to the ware. The difficulty here is that pigmented glazes change their colours dramatically during firing so aim is to open a kiln and feel happy seeing the final result. That is why I work with colours a lot and try to achieve outstanding combination of vivacity and clarity of the glaze. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"22322067\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/322/067/1aae06634217ff5415a3d53da0956680_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1535028144&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=62347861072ca52ffd74ad149cd84a73\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"22322196\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/322/196/c52ba9506d9bd17df60af585575d8eb8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1535029246&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=772c86847bf1db87fd7be335a5224b7e\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Ceramic fantasies.\n&nbsp;</span></p><p>I always look for new ideas, and they come from where you don’t expect them. Once I had a chat with my sparring partner after a workout, a man of technical mindset to the core. He couldn’t be further away from art. However, it was him who has given me the idea of combining art and science. My gym buddy had experimented with the conversion of heat by semiconducting elements directly into electricity (so called Seebek effect). So we decided to combine this technology with my ceramic ware. We have put together an experimental device that has a conventional candle as a heat source. Body of the device is designed as a house that is made of fired and glazed terra cotta, and it’s got a thermogenerator with LEDs connected to it installed inside of the model. (подробнее, ссылка для перехода на расширенное описание). The effect was stunning. Small windows of the house slowly get lit with different colours as if there was a fireplace and Christmas lights inside. You feel enchanted, it’s like a gingerbread house from our childhood memories. It is definitely something that creates positive emotions.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Kickstarter</span>\n&nbsp;</p><p>We have taken this project to Kickstarter as we want to improve the technical components of it, increase capacity of the generator and add more commercial “gloss” to our model. As a result, we want our device to also be used as a USB charger (for smartphones, for example). Generated by the device heat can also be utilised – we are working on adding an aroma lamp functionality, so that the relaxing effect would also be achieved not only visually but also through the sense of smell.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"22322179\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/322/179/572a52b78eb2bef62e832a80ed54ddb8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1535029137&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ff91b0404a27b4d20da0bf669735c0d8\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">In the 8 months after the campaign, there is a lot to do: We need to manufacture the tooling, produce and assemble all parts, package the Handmade lodge lamp.\r\n\r\nWe have also confirmed that this shipping date is realistic with our production partners. However, there is always a risk that because of unforeseen circumstances that will lead to delays in the planned process. Of course, we will try our best to avoid those.\r\n\r\nTo keep you informed about everything that's happening, we promise to keep you posted regularly on the progress while your Handmade lodge lamp are in the making and on their way to you!!</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":3,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">NZ$ 7</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nJoin the community\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Thank you for you support!</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2018-10-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Oct 2018</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">NZ$ 75</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 44</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSouvenier from the artist\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A handmade souvenier from the artist and our deep gratitude for your support.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2018-12-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Dec 2018</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">NZ$ 380</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 221</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nHandmade lodge lamp\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Majolica-glazed terra cotta lamp that can be used in any lounge to decorate the space.
