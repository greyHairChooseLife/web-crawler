I'm a Ceramic Artist from Queensland Australia. I left the daily grind after my second cancer diagnosis in 2016 and became a student potter. Throwing on the wheel was such a wonderful form of physiotherapy and aided my mental health and recovery. I really fell in love with the art, and in alot of ways it gave me hope that my life could have joy again. I started a small business named Indie Bay (a mash of my husky Indies name and Byron Bay NSW, a town near where I grew up and my fave place in the world) ×","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Carolyn Ann Attwood","creator_last_login":1571454257,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.etsy.com/shop/indiebayart","domain":"etsy.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/023/102/811/265ba7728b172a3fa06f82fbeda0e0a2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1571453014&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=b28fb518ea8fb1ebc2f4dfd4cf303257","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/indiebay","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>In 2016 I was diagnosed with cancer... again (yeah I know but I promise you this isn't a sob story. I plan to work hard on my business, it just helps explain how I got here). After my treatment my arm and shoulder became frozen and damaged and my mental health declined. I went to physio, but I also started pottery classes. Throwing on the wheel was a great form of physio and mental health recovery after the trauma of cancer, and I just fell in LOVE with the art of ceramics and life all over again!&nbsp;</p><p>I'm strong and getting well and my art has progressed in leaps and bounds. My Family even chipped in and set me up with my own pottery wheel and studio at home and I started an Etsy store and a markets, a thriving Instagram community and I'm so delighted that people are buying my work, contacting me for custom orders and loving my art so much!</p><p>I LOVE making fiddly things, Its my favourite thing, and everyone seems to love them too, I've even had my work hand selected for exhibitions! (but here comes the actual sad part..no it's not the cancer, that was the sucky part) The sad part is that because my work is intricate it is fragile before it has been fired and keeps getting broken either on the long drive to the studio or in the communal kiln when its getting fired because it gets over stacked (I spend hours on the detail of my pieces, so it's always full of aaaargh! moments when they are broken). The short of it is that I'd love to earn enough money to buy my own kiln (yep, no handouts I'm here to earn it!)&nbsp;</p><p>With my very own kiln I can get as fiddly and intricate as I want and fire my work at home (*insert celebratory noises here because that would be heaven*). Kilns are OMG expensive (like next level!). So I'd love your help to get there! Buy a mug for a kiln?! Yep, just imagine holding that fiddly intricate mug of goodness on a Saturday morning on the porch thinking yeah, I'm drinking out of my one of a kind hand forged mug while I support the arts, the environment, and one happy little potter... sounds like heaven!</p><p>The base model skutt kiln is $2650 aud, the more money I can collect in excess of this, the bigger the kiln I can buy, and the more lovely fiddly things I can make for the world (and bigger ones too because the kiln will have more room, yass!)</p><p>Thanks for supporting my work x</p><p>Best</p><p>-Carolyn (cancer slaying, mug making... soon to be kiln baking?
