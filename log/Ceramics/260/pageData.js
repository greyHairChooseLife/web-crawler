I'm raising money to purchase this piece of equipment, and to buy and build some other basic items to start my home studio.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a wheel - and studio - at home is largely a matter of convenience, and also one of economics and time management. Although I'll continue enrollment at Arapahoe Community College, the reality is that using a community studio exclusively sets up several barriers to reaching my goals. </p><p>A good wheel is an investment that seldom needs replacement. There are a lot of middling-quality wheels out there, suitable for hobby use, but not really up to production work. Good used wheels sometimes come up for sale, but they're few and far between. Of course, if the opportunity arises I'll take it, but realistically to get a wheel this fall I'm going to have to buy a new one.&nbsp;</p><p>The $3000 funding goal is budgeted to cover the cost of a new electric potters wheel, the costs of purchasing clay and paying for shipping of rewards, and the fees involved in running a Kickstarter campaign.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:rewards\" class=\"page-anchor\">Rewards&nbsp;</h1><p>The really fun part of this project is making the rewards for my backers. I'm offering a mixture of functional wares made on the wheel. Check out the Rewards for descriptions, groups, and pricing; here are some examples of the wares included in the Rewards:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Large bowls for pasta, salad, or noodles.

They're made of durable stoneware and will provide years of use. I prefer to use atmospheric firings - either in a wood-fired kiln, or in a salt firing. These atmospheric firings produce beautiful variable and organic results. Keep in mind that hand-made pottery varies somewhat in the finished shapes and how the glazes develop in those environmental kiln environments. I find the effects of fire on chemicals and materials to be surprising and satisfying every time I open a freshly-fired kiln.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:fulfillment\" class=\"page-anchor\">Fulfillment</h1><p>Because I'll be firing your rewards at the ACC kilns, I've got some time restrictions on when I can get them done. The studio typically runs two atmospheric kiln firings a semester and ideally I can get all pieces made, fired, and shipped by the winter gifting season. Unless we have firing issues; see the \"Risks\" section for details. In which case I make more pottery, and prepare for the spring firings.&nbsp;<br><br>Shipping will be via the cheapest route I can find. However, due to the size and weight of pottery, I regret that shipping costs are pretty high. If you're local, I'd love to give you the opportunity to pick up your reward at a convenient time and place. I won't be able to refund shipping costs, but I'll be happy to include a small bonus piece of pottery to offset your investment. Some possibilities include chopstick rests, or a sauce or teabag dish.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:maybe-you-dont-see-j\" class=\"page-anchor\">Maybe you don't see just the right combo of wares...</h1><p>... I'll be happy to create your own package for you. Of course, more stuff in the package means lower shipping costs per piece, so it's a win-in. Just message me with your requests! (Credit to Matilda for this idea.)</p><h1 id=\"h:whats-next\" class=\"page-anchor\">What's next?</h1><p>Of course, funding a wheel is just the first step in this project. There are lots of studio supplies to acquire; things like shelving and wedging tables, and a slab roller. I'll eventually need an electric kiln at home. If the backing funds exceed the Kickstarter goal I'll be rolling over monies into that next purchase.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">My personal challenge:\r\n\r\nI'm working toward mastery in pottery. For most artists, it's a multi-year process to become adept at throwing. I have about two years of intensive study so far and while my skills are certainly passable, I'm by no means a master. Part of the path toward mastery is to have my own home studio; proximity promotes practice. The more I create in clay, the more I discover refinements which improve the quality of my work. I expect a significant improvement by fulfillment time. I consider this a personal challenge.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's a chicken-egg issue - having a wheel is necessary for skills development; better skills means having the resources to fund a personal studio. I have to start somewhere, and although there's room for growth, there's also a lot of beauty and technical skill in my work.\r\n\r\nTechnical risks:\r\n\r\nThe other big unknown is that it's pottery. Simply put, every kiln is a risk and reward. The line between success and disaster is pretty fine in an atmospheric kiln; the best results happen when we go very near that line, but because we're playing with fire, occasionally something ... bad happens. A kiln shelf breaks, or a tall piece collapses and dominos onto other pieces, or wood gets fed onto the kiln stack. Sometimes they just don't fire like you want them to. Sometimes there just isn't room in the kiln for every pot, and sometimes the glazes fail for one of several reasons. Of course, I'll be making every effort to get maximum amounts of pottery in every available kiln load. However, there are just 2 wood and salt firings per semester, and space is limited - and if a firing fails for whatever reason, it could mean delays to the delivery of rewards, or a change to a method different from my preferred atmospheric firings. \r\n\r\nThe good news is that all my backers have access to frequent updates. If I encounter any production snafus, you'll be among the first to know.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0yMDUwNzE0NDA=","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":22,"number_of_comments_depth_all":10,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nThe pottery wheel is the potter's most basic tool - and one of the most expensive.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/122/173/a4db25b1e2a4dc9d1118acfab704036d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463737867&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=87505915128ae37bf7bd35e9273b63d6","last_updated":"April 22, 2020","project_name":"andWerks - Creating the Whee","pledgedOrigin":"$3,198","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"3,000","amount_of_pledged":"3,198","rate_of_funded":106,"number_of_backers":"57","project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Denver, CO","top_cities_location_1st":"Denver United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"13","top_cities_location_2st":"Colorado Springs United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"4","top_cities_location_3st":"Longmont United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"4","top_cities_location_4st":"Aurora United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"2","top_cities_location_5st":"Boulder United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"2","top_cities_location_6st":"Allentown United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Altadena United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Ann Arbor United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Arlington United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Bozeman United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"57","number_of_new_backers":8,"number_of_returning_backers":49,"creator_name":"Melanie Unruh","creator_location":"Denver, CO","creator_description":"Melanie is an experienced artist/artisan, working in a wide range of media for the entirety of her life.
