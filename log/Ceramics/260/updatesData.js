In spite of being chronically short on time for the months of October and November, I was able to get some bowls into production. Last weekend, I broke a lot of them. On purpose.<br><br>To be fair, I did get a handful of bowls out of the production run that are \"sale-able\". I'll be shipping those this weekend. <br><br>The bowls that I showed you all in October - the ones with pinholes - were culled [1], and I put the ones that seemed reparable back into a firing late in November. And the pin-holing got <i>worse</i>, instead of better. Conferring with several people in the studio turns up no obvious reason. My glazing process seems standard. <br><br>So we broke several. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"19592246\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/019/592/246/edc3a373cbac3ee5ef5bc31e71f2ad19_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1513201954&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b2a5afd3cfcec56b0ae484e994350bc5\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>In short, <i>there's nothing wrong</i> with the glaze. Right thickness, even application, etc. Maybe it's the clay??<br><br>(I also put about a dozen bowls in the salt firing late in November. Every single one came out with kiln debris glazed into in the bottom of the bowls. More loss.)</p><p><b>So frustrating!!</b></p><p>So I did some tests, using a slightly different glaze formulation. Amazingly enough, there were no pinholes! The glaze that worked better is a tiny bit more yellow, but it's still a lovely combination. No idea why; the \"yellow salt\" has a tiny bit of iron oxide in it, which might be acting as both a flux and a colorant, and that could be helping the situation. <br><br>The other factor interrupting production this semester is that our wood kiln has been in the replacement process since July or August. I've got several sets of bowls ready to go into that kiln (Julie's among them!), but no firings. I hear that we'll have a wood firing this month (the kiln was finished a couple of weeks ago), but realistically I don't expect anything until March. <br><br>We're in the winter lull between semesters, so not much is going on for a few weeks. This project is slow, but there's always something in production for the Kickstarter. At the moment, I've glazed everything that I made this past semester, and it's either ready for shipping, wasted, or waiting on a firing. The first thing to happen next month will be making more bowls. <br><br><b>However. </b><br><br>I am producing other stuff, so I can keep using the college studio and so I can keep buying clay. Bowls are bread and butter at sales, and honestly, I've put all my bowl production into Kickstarter bowls. This means that while I have some odd shapes and one-offs in sales, I haven't been able to produce any sets because they're all going into this project.

In short, a piece with pinholing is no longer food-safe because it can't be cleaned out. (If you click on the photo, I <i>think</i> that it will take you to my professional Facebook page, where I recorded my frustration.) Pinholing can happen due to a number of factors, but is most likely organic carbon remaining in the clay after the bisque firing. Or the glaze is too thick. It could also be how the kiln is fired. In truth, it's probably all three factors working together to create maximum glaze mayhem. </p><p>Every piece I make is carefully inspected after it comes out of the firing; glaze defects are one factor that decides whether a piece is of good enough quality to pass it on to customers. If I'm not proud of it, it doesn't leave the studio. Even though the glaze on this batch of bowls is just gorgeous (look at that hare's fur!) the pinholing is a no-go. </p><p>So, I shipped what was great quality late in the spring, and at the beginning of the summer semester, I was back at the wheel. I made 27 bowls this summer, all of them in sets - that is to say same shape/size/glaze. That's 50+ pounds of clay, and many, many hours of making, loading and unloading kilns, and glazing. Lots of resources. I changed the bisque firing routine to more completely burn out carbon; I changed the glazing routine to thinner glaze depths. </p><p>And another deeply disappointing firing later, I can report about a 80% loss rate. One bowl broke before glaze firing. Several have too-thin glaze on the white interior; there is an oxidation failure on a couple. The white glaze didn't mature properly on about 6 of them. In short, there are no complete sets out of that firing, and sets are most of what I owe you backers. </p><p>And so it's back to the wheel with another 50+ pounds of clay. </p><p>I keep a production log of the pottery I make, partly to record the clay, glaze, and firings for future reference; what worked, what didn't, what broke or failed in production. Last night, as I was wedging clay for the next production run of Kickstarter bowls, I checked the summer's production log for the clay weights that I wanted to prep and did the addition. It was depressing. </p><div>\n<p>The good thing about working in a large studio is that there are many people who have myriad experiences. \"What works consistently?\" I've asked, looking for something reliable that's still cool and interesting for you all.

Last weekend, I threw a lot of stuff, among which are 9 yunomi. </p><p>An yunomi is a Japanese-style informal tea bowl or cup. They're taller and narrower than a chawan, the formal tea bowl used in the tea ceremony; they're about the dimensions of a narrow coffee mug, without a handle. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Thrown base forms for yunomi\" data-caption=\"Thrown base forms for yunomi\" data-id=\"4568759\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Thrown base forms for yunomi\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/568/759/dbb94bc132d2087703136d6aa7413d14_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1443200656&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=da0c43b5aad7780501f153ee16784b0d\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Thrown base forms for yunomi</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>My yunomi are made of a smooth stoneware clay that's designed to perform well in wood kilns. Wood ash is deposited on the pottery surfaces as the ash blows through the kiln.  Wood ash is mostly calcium carbonate, a flux which combines with the silica in the clay to create a glassy, glaze-like surface. Because the circulation throughout a wood-fired kiln is uneven, surfaces grab the ash variably.  </p><p>Layers of slip made of the same clay is applied to the exterior of the yunomi. It goes on like frosting; I even use a frosting spatula to apply it. The resulting surface is undulating and tactile, and is especially satisfying when your fingers wrap around the warm tea-filled bowl. The folds and rivulets of slip also grab glaze and wood ash, creating an organic surface melange of color, intensity, and tactile effects. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Slipped and ready for trimming\" data-caption=\"Slipped and ready for trimming\" data-id=\"4569113\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Slipped and ready for trimming\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/569/113/cb178d8366543a8f5d7cbc119bf66f69_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1443203249&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=169822693391c8c2cb0b67eefe68e800\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Slipped and ready for trimming</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I try to not be too consistent with the slip; although the hand of the maker is evident due to the throwing lines in the base form, each one should look like it has steeped in and emerged from the water or the forest, shaped by natural forces rather than by the hand. I'll sometimes re-form the cups at this point, adding thumb rests of making them triangular or square-ish. I may slash an imprint or use stamps to add individuality to each one. </p><p>The next step is to trim the foot. One of the benefits of Japanese-style tea bowls is that they don't have handles. If you pick it up and it's too hot to hold, it's also too hot to drink! However, the high foot makes it easier to handle with your thumb on the rim and a finger under the foot. No, this doesn't mean that it's actually cool enough to drink, but you might be able to carry it from the kitchen to your reading chair. </p><p>I've done a rough finish in the past, and actually prefer it. The facets and irregularities are aesthetically consistent with the slip covering, and they grab more of the ash flow in the wood kiln. However, I'm also doing a more refined finished foot, round and smooth. You may like it better. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A rough-cut foot\" data-caption=\"A rough-cut foot\" data-id=\"4570620\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A rough-cut foot\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/570/620/8d8c81bc620ef60808f335375f98e366_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1443217475&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=41c614082ceb54525cfee5bab9fa0f77\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A rough-cut foot</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>If you know me, you know how I feel about traditional things. A wood kiln is the original kiln, developed over millennia (largely by the Japanese through the anagama kiln) into the modern train style kiln that I use at the ACC studio. The shape has changed, but the theory has not - get as much wood ash and heat across the pottery as possible. Wood ash works best with certain traditional glazes; among these are the shinos, developed by (you guessed it) the Japanese. Shinos marry the texture of the pottery with the chemistry of the wood kiln. Up to his point I've used about 4 different shinos, but I think I'm going to do some testing to find some new glazes. I'll be previewing some of them here in a couple of weeks. </p><p>I like to line the interior in Dresang shino, which is fundamentally clear; it also picks up speckling from the ash. Against the white clay body, green tea looks like a pale emerald in the bowl. </p><p>The next wood firing is October 23. Stay tuned for results. </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1443121466,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEzNTYyNzE=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Fresh pottery","publishedAt":1443121466,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Melanie Unruh","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/840/861/163722703a3646909e97d224216d3357_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461638173&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=7113323119429bbb2c4cbeb45af4ff5e","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>I've got a fresh batch of pottery in hand, following the weekend's salt firing.

Their color comes from an optical effect of light bouncing around in microscopic bubbles in the glaze. It's said that they work really well over iron- or copper-bearing glazes or slips. This adds a step to the pipeline, but from what I've seen, the effects are worth it. The long tradition of using Chün glazes make them very attractive to me and I'm considering adding them into the Shinos that I prefer for wood firings. </p><p>Speaking of which, I'm going to be making up some glaze samples soon. Our Shino stock at the studio has dwindled, and I'm looking for some interesting recipes. And I'm really fascinated by the Chüns. I'll be posting pictures in a couple of weeks. </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1442499487,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEzNTQxMDc=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"This risky business","publishedAt":1442499487,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Melanie Unruh","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/840/861/163722703a3646909e97d224216d3357_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461638173&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=7113323119429bbb2c4cbeb45af4ff5e","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>I popped into the studio last night to take care of a couple of quick things. The studio assistant asked me, \"did you have anything in the weekend's gas kiln?\" I shook my head, \"no.\" </p><p>\"Good,\" he said, looking at me with a very significant look. His hands were out in front of him in a cautionary posture. \"We had a pot *explode* in there. It got on everything.\" </p><p>I went to have a look. One large pot had exploded with enough force that there were pieces stuck in the soft brick of the kiln walls. I pulled a couple of pieces out and looked inside them; sure enough, there were crumbs of the exploding pot adhered into the glaze on the inside bottoms of cups and bowls. </p><p>This was a re-fire pot. Although it's terrifically unusual for a previously-fired pot to go boom, it's just another example of what can go wrong. Sheila pointed out once that it's not the cost of producing a pot that you're paying for when you buy my pottery; it's all the trials and failures that have gone before, that this time all the factors came together to produce a worthy item. The potters who have work in that kiln have lost a lot of time; perhaps one was preparing for a sale and will have substantially less stock to sell. This is why we have kiln gods. </p><p>The \"couple of items that I popped in for\" involved checking on about a dozen bowls that I'm working on in preparation for making rewards. They're the large noodle/pasta/salad bowls, that are meant to fire in a salt kiln. There's one running this weekend, and I've shoehorned my way into it. I'm testing the chopstick rest concept with some of these, as well as watching how the glazes perform with the salt. The past two iterations have shown that I need to make the rests smaller and maybe sit them on top of the rim, not as holes in the rim (the points want to slide through), or smaller, or...? Also, the four in the pictures were fired to cone 6 (2232 degrees F) and I don't think that the glaze matured. This weekend will be a cone 10 firing (2381 degrees), so I expect the glazes to perform well. </p><p>Pictures on Tuesday, kiln gods willing. </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1442353659,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"3000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"3198.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":57,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
