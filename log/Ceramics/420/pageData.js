The title picture is the prototype of what will be produced but made by stamping my barnyard rescues hooves instead of a dog or cat. I plan on making these out of a high temperature fired clay like stoneware so that they are extremely durable, they should be able to be carried around in a pocket to be used as a worry stone, forgotten and thrown into the washer and drier and still be just fine.&nbsp;</p><p>So often I see dog and cat rescues, horses, or exotic animal rescues but there are little ones that are always forgotten. I started taking in sick ruminants about a year ago as the need arose for some one to champion these little hoofed creatures. On average goat and sheep breeders accept a five percent loss in their herd, orphaned babies and little ones not given the care they need by chance started to find their way to my doorstep, and I found that I could not refuse them. I soon realized that unfortunately love does not put milk in their bottles, or medicine in their bellies but wrestled with coming up with ideas on how to support these little ones.&nbsp;</p><p>As we were sinking a post to fix a fence one of my little angels curiously stuck his cloven hoof in the hardening concrete and an idea was born! To create a sustainable rescue fund I want to build a small shed with pottery supplies to make hooves for hope, hoof medallions made by these sweet little ruminants created by them, glazed and fired by me! My end goal is to create a nonprofit organization that facilitates the rescue and adoption of these sweet forgotten angels, but first it must be self sustainable. Right now my bottle babies have free roam of my kitchen, and older rescues wander the four acres I have fenced in, anything over the pledge amount will go to building a climate controlled barn on our property where the animals can get out of the heat and cold, and provide a place for the bottle babies so that I can have my kitchen back! I do find suitable homes for my rescues, and personally drop these little ruminants off to be sure that the adopting parents are ready and knowledgeable about the little one they are taking on.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the pledge amount is reached construction will commence and little hoof medallions will be made and sent out as soon as possible! This pledge is a small first step to a much bigger cause, what starts with a kiln and pottery supplies in an outbuilding will hopefully impact the lives of countless little ruminants by creating a self sustainable rescue operation, Hooves for hope thanks you!

I am already helping sick little ones with what I have available to me, and have no doubt that this can and will work! Upon completion I will open an Etsy account and create a Facebook page for the rescue so that you can check on the progress! I have good friends that work with clay for a living and have a great support group in them for all of my clay working questions, they are very excited to help get this project rolling!</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A picture of a little barnyard friend you are helping to begin a sustainable future for!</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-09-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sep 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A Hoof print in clay made by a little angel you gave wings!</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-10-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Oct 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n3 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 15</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 15</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A Hoof print in clay made by a little angel you gave wings, as well as a picture of the little fuzzy while creating your treasure!</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-10-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Oct 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n4 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A new hoof print in clay every month for a year!

Firstly my home is not large enough to accommodate a kiln and clay working area, so I will need to build a small outbuilding that has some insulation to protect from the heat we get here in the summer time. With the summer storms we get here it will need to have a decent foundation that is some what raised to protect from flooding. Also I have been informed that a kiln requires special attention to the electrical systems backing it or it could be a fire hazard, so I will have to hire an electrician to come and wire me up! Secondly A kiln itself is not a cheep piece of equipment, and I want to be sure that I get a quality kiln that can fire at cone 08-10 so that I can make a quality product and not have to worry about breakdowns in the foreseeable future, due to the fact that i will be firing to cone 10 regularly I will need a kiln that is capable of doing this, and must have it direct wired (no outlet plug). Lastly I will need to purchase clay working supplies like kiln furniture, 5 gallon buckets, the clay itself, as well as glazes which will depend on the type of kiln I choose (electric or gas). I think I will go for an electric kiln because even at cone 08-10 I still have a good range of colors to choose from. All in all after sitting down with my hubby and discussing the cost of building an outbuilding and researching the cost of a kiln ( I did look for used kilns but could not find any in my area) we came to the conclusion that it will take about $10,000 to get it all done. Unfortunately being in Texas the price of wood is astronomical, coming from Oregon this shocked me a bit but I guess I do not have the privilege of being near such an abundance of forest anymore. \n<br>I do hope I have answered your question! Thank you very much for your time and consideration!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"type-12 navy-500 mb3\">\nLast updated: <time datetime=\"2014-07-20T14:21:00-04:00\" data-format=\"llll z\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Mon, July 21 2014 3:21 AM UTC +09:00</time>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"],"last_updated":"August 17, 2014"}
