Yesterday was a rainy day here in New Orleans, and in the flashy light of the clouds the mug had a few red undertones, nothing to be thrilled about. But upstairs in my apartment, especially under the cook white LED light of my kitchen there are blues and yellows and oh wow.  The best was when I was warming the mug while brewing coffee. The bottom has a truly mesmerizing swirl that was brought out by the water in the mug.\n\nIt's kind of like going out at night to look at the actual night sky. At first, there is not much more than a dark sky. But the more you look, and the more you look with different equipment (lights) the more you see.\n\nWhatever, you like it you don't, it's a personal choice. As for me I have a great new interestingly shaped, HUGE mug. \n\nAnd Joel, I opted for the aeropress for my first cup. Solely because it takes 45 seconds not 4-5 minutes to brew.

I'll keep exploring!\n\nHello Michael, thanks for reaching out about your mugs and for backing our Cosmic Mug Kickstarter. I'm sorry that you and your mother don't like the mugs. I'm sorry if the colors do not seem the same on your mugs as some of the photos on my website, social media and Kickstarter, but I would encourage you to live with your pottery for more than a day or two. Explore the colors in different settings. Look at them under bright light. Take the mug outside in direct sunlight. More colors will appear. It is true that some mugs come out with darker pallets, as the process is impossible to fully predict and replicate from firing to firing. However, please understand that pottery mugs are not like machine made mugs. The colors are intricate and have a lot of depth, requiring you to look very closely. Complexity is often revealed over time. \n\nPlease take just a couple minutes to watch part of this YouTube video that describes how qualities in pottery differ from those in machine made mugs. Pete Pinnell is a ceramics professor, and at 17 minutes 25 seconds into this video Pete describes a pottery mug that he bought years ago. At first, he didn't like using the mug. Over time, more complexities were revealed and it because one of his favorites:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WChFMMzLHVs\n\nThanks anyways for your support and I will keep working towards the ongoing process of consistency between our online pottery colors and pottery colors in person.","createdAt":1450724218,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xNjgwMDExMDk3","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/919/252/1c0a1af9b24c40606e8f6cba9c87acbb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1461549825&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=43e4c7eefdd152e62afd5651b1afff4c","name":"Joel Cherrico","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/cherricopottery"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0xMjEwNDg4Mg==","body":"I got mine in the mail today and I have to say I was completely underwhelmed by them.
