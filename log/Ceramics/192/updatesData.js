From Canberra I will head up to the Gold Coast to meet the artisans involved with the Gold Coast Potter Potters Association (July 19th), then I'm off to Lismore to meet the artisans of Northern Rivers Pottery Supplies (Aug 1st &amp; 2nd), after which I'm off to Auckland to meet the Auckland Studio Potters (Aug 8th &amp; 9th) at each one of these stops I will have time to research &amp; photograph at the Botanical Gardens as well as touring their galleries. I'm so looking forward to sharing this adventure with all of you.
