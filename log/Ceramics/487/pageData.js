I’m trying to set up a home studio. I’m a student and can’t afford all the equipment I need. This money will help me buy a wheel and slab-roller. The pictures attached are one from each- the bowl is from a wheel and the sculpture is slab built- they are both my own works.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I want to use this money to help me achieve my goal of being a ceramic artist. I will use the wheel to make bowls and cups. Making dinnerware is something I really enjoy doing and can develop my own personal line.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The slab roller will help me make scultpural pieces like the one pictures above. If you donate in the third tier, the porcelain fortune cookies are made with a slab roller! I roll out clay, like you would with dough, and then cut and fold exactly like making a real fortune cookie. I already have a kiln, so the next step in my creative journey is a wheel and slab roller.</p>\n<p>The wheel is something I am proficient on from taking classes. I use clay on the wheel to make round things: plates, bowls, cups, vases, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I want to be an independent, self-supporting artist but I need help getting on my feet. I appreciate any help you can give me as it is very difficult to find footing as a young, new artist and a college student. Included are a couple pictures of ceramic works I have made. I typically work with stoneware, meaning most of my work is food and water safe. I occasionally work with raku to make sculptural pieces. Being a student and newish to clay, however, I haven’t been able to figure out which I’ll end up doing more of- more experimentation will help me find that. I have 2 years experience in ceramics, but would love to make it my life’s work. I have looked extensively into pricing on potting equipment, and have personally tried several brands to find the right one for me and my clay needs.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">It’s hard to get started as artist, because you need money to get started but you can’t really start making money until you get started so it kind of goes in a circle until you get set up. I’ve tried low cost equipment before but it yields low quality work, resulting in failed projects and lost money and supplies. I have found my passion in art, but really help to make my dream of being an independent artist come true. \nThis project of getting my studio to working order would help me in my entire life. Getting set up now would put me so far ahead in my plans, I could start my ceramic business almost immediately after getting this equipment.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold
