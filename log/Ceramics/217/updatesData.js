I wanted to show you all what I've been working on for you for the past couple of months. I've been taking lots of photos so you can see my process in full and discover what really goes into making ceramic art!</p><p>It took several weeks for my shipment to process after I ordered everything. I found out  that the company I ordered from didn't have enough of the clay I wanted in stock, so I substituted a different clay for the remainder. At the end of June, while waiting for my shipment to arrive, I did my first test-firing of the kiln to make sure everything was functioning properly before firing any actual work in it. First I made sure the kiln was level, and then applied kiln wash to the shelves. Kiln wash is a protective layer of ceramic material that prevents glaze from sticking to the shelves and ruining them. It should be fired onto the shelves in an empty kiln before firing pots on them.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Applying kiln wash to the shelves!\" data-caption=\"Applying kiln wash to the shelves!\" data-id=\"4356000\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Applying kiln wash to the shelves!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/356/000/80dd6c500fe281188d97f0ad7fc69262_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1440175158&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c255ed6419f2741febdb330e5de3aac4\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Applying kiln wash to the shelves!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><br>After applying the kiln wash, I did my test-firing. I put a cone pack on each shelf level in the kiln so I could see how evenly the heat was dispersed. Cones are made of ceramic material and are designed to melt at specific temperatures. The cones I used go in order from left to right (cooler to hotter) as cone 05, 04, and 03; cone 05 actually melts at a LOWER temperature than cone 03. I only fired to cone 04, which is 1945 degrees Fahrenheit (bisque temperature, or the first phase of firing pots). These are my results!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Cone packs! (left to right) Bottom shelf, middle, top\" data-caption=\"Cone packs!

This tells me that the bottom of the kiln got a little hotter than the top, which makes sense because my kiln is top-loading, so heat escapes more easily from the top. The difference was very slight, so it poses no real issue when firing my work. However, I could add some insulating ceramic fiber blanket between the lid and kiln body if I wanted.</p><p><br>My supplies were finally delivered at the beginning of July.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"572 lbs. of clay and 180 lbs. of dry glaze\" data-caption=\"572 lbs. of clay and 180 lbs. of dry glaze\" data-id=\"4355907\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"572 lbs. of clay and 180 lbs. of dry glaze\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/355/907/a52a77bcf080c14843bc357b4fd3b706_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1440174147&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=229128741cea102c117923a5be7d9ff7\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">572 lbs. of clay and 180 lbs. of dry glaze</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I hauled 26  22-lb. bags of clay from my garage to my basement studio.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"All this plus 8 more bags I already brought in\" data-caption=\"All this plus 8 more bags I already brought in\" data-id=\"4355923\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"All this plus 8 more bags I already brought in\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/355/923/4c9bc0b67d3abc8b51a5969bb7a12306_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1440174331&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e2f05a40acedd88385d2b8b2422c0b13\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">All this plus 8 more bags I already brought in</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Since the beginning of June, I've also been working on lots of pots.

Next will be glazing them, and firing again at cone 10, 2345 degrees Fahrenheit. Cone 10 is completely food-safe temperature because the ceramic is vitrified at that point so food particles cannot be absorbed. After that, the royal pieces will be fired once more at a much lower temperature of cone 018 with gold luster on the buttons. I have 21 more pieces drying slowly under plastic on the back table waiting to be bisqued, and 34 more pieces downstairs I will be finishing next week. I will be doing the next bisque most likely at the end of next week!  I'm creating a bunch more than I need, that way I can choose the best of the best to send to all of you amazing backers who I am so thankful for! I have 97 pieces so far and the dragons will be next! Who's excited?!<br><br>Lastly, I will also be working on making a throwing video so you will all get to see me throw some pots!

Once I start making the new pieces, I will post photo updates of my progress to share with you. I will message you within the next couple of weeks for your shipping addresses as well.
