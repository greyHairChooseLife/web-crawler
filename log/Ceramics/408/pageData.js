Our studio will offer a space for local potters to work from, as well as a platform for them to showcase their work. We are poised in a unique neighborhood (located in Bentonville, Arkansas) that is already heavily invested in the arts, and meeting a need for studios that value innovation and excellence. The key is in our strong group of core artists who value furthering their craft and passing on their skills through instruction. This core group of artists will be the foundational in our studio.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We want to make it as simple as possible for our artists to connect with the consumer. Fifth Street Studio will be the bridge, we will have the ability to serve customers with larger wholesale needs as well as give our artists a longer reach into online markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We value where we have come from as individuals and as a community, and wish to pass the art of ceramics on.&nbsp;Through history ceramics have been the mark of a people group, when we go back to analyze a civilization we first look at their pottery. We feel a calling, as ceramic artists of our day, to preserve our cultural heritage and reinterpret it in a modern way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Simplicity in equipment will allow us to put effort into high quality raw materials to work with, and the layout will maximize use of the studio space allowing for complete transparency in the whole of the process of pottery. Our facility will house seven pottery wheels, an industrial kiln, and a plug mill. This equipment is essential in the production of pottery. In addition high quality clay and glazes are needed to produce quality ceramic wares.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://fifthstreet.studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"22730651\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/730/651/48f0577f2e66bee88489143a8bfedf2a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1538348008&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=addfab10ae734ca3ea541b4932806f49\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</a>\n\n<h1 id=\"h:membership-and-class\" class=\"page-anchor\">MEMBERSHIP and CLASS OFFERING&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>Open Studio Core Membership – (9a-10p daily - Members at this level have shown significant dedication to the craft of pottery as well as to Fifth Street Studio.

As I hope you can see, this business means quite a lot to me. I've put in countless hours structuring and restructuring the model for an effective studio that serves its members and the community well. I'm thrilled to present it to you now. A bit about me, I work as an educator and found ceramics as a lovely way to de-stress. I quickly fell in love. I have made friends along the way and they (as well as my lovely mother) inspired me to press into my dream of managing a studio. So here I am! I was also heavily invested in the cultural tradion of my hometown in regards to pottery. We have many native american artifacts that give us an idea of how humans lived in the past. This cultural tradition is being lost, and as part of the Choctaw tribe I want to bring influences of my roots back into my work as an artist. I seek to preserve my cultural heritage by reinterpreting Choctaw pottery through a modern lens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BreAnna - She's a dedicated artisan in many different veins. Anything from leather work to master seamstress skills, this girl is all about it. She owns and operates Authentic Sundry, supplying aprons and leather goods world wide. BreAnna is also a professional photographer, you will be seeing her work all over our instagram and other social outlets. I forgot to mention her obvious other love in the craft world, pottery. With her eye for composure and hand for precision she crafts marvelous ceramic ware.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fifthstreetstudio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"22730666\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/730/666/2036a57915f56f04a202dfe2b23ff71e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1538348174&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=0b772f140d539d8bb20ae11fa49f634a\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</a>\n\n<p>Thank you for your support, and for reading to the bottom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With love,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 5th Street Team&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">We have already been facing the challenge of funding.
