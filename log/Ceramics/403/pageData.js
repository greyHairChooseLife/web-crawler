I have lived in Leesburg, Virginia for 9 years and have outgrown my home pottery studio. I am raising funds to move to shared retail/studio space where I will continue to make my ceramic works of art, sell my work, and instruct others in the love and art of clay.</p><p>Here's my story:</p>My passion is working with clay - a soft malleable substance - throwing, forming, and urging it into an object of both beauty and function. An object, which can be admired, touched, held, and used in daily life. This process and transformation of the soft clay into a hard and beautiful object meant to be seen, used, passed along, maybe even eventually broken and given back to the earth seems to mirror personal growth and transformation. I use mid-range fired stoneware and porcelain in my work and enjoy glaze colors and themes, which can be found in nature. I try to incorporate a combination of family, prayer, meditation, nature, and the creation of pottery into every single day of my life as part of my own personal growth and transformation. It gives me great insight and joy to create a one of a kind piece of artwork. I hope others enjoy viewing and utilizing the pottery as much as I enjoyed making it!<div>&nbsp;<div>\n<p>I am an avid cook and have been experimenting the past few year with various forms of bake-ware, serving pieces, and other items that enhance the culinary experience. \n\n I have been making pieces to become part of your daily life as well as pieces that become part of your traditions and celebrations!  I look forward to sharing my latest functional and decorative creations with you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have been a studio potter for 12 years and display and sell my work in various galleries in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. I have taught most recently at The Cooley Gallery in Leesburg &nbsp;and create my work (and recipes) at my home studio in Leesburg, Virginia. To learn more about my work please visit my website: <span class=\"bold\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amymansonpottery.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Http://www.amymansonpottery.com</a></span></p>\n<p>A little more about me:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I sell my pottery to an established Loudoun county clientele and online throughout the Country. I regularly work on commission pottery pieces as well as wholesale orders. I have been teaching adult and children’s programming in Loudoun County for 9 years and previously in Charlotte, NC. I have worked to become a highly respected artist and instructor in the community. I have a large patronage and sell pottery in all sections of the county, from wineries and vineyards, to galleries, art shows, fairs and direct sales. Over the years I have also also built a loyal and amazingly talented following of students who have returned again and again, for continued instruction. I have been fortunate to have been featured in local newspapers and magazines, as well as regional and statewide publications. I am also a mom of two amazing daughters, a wife to a very patient fellow, and pack leader to a 12 year old golden retriever, and a 7 year old Husky/Shepard mix.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here's the plan:</p>\n<p>I have outgrown my home studio and am moving to a shared studio space in central Leesburg. I will be making this space my personal studio, and teaching space. &nbsp;I realized about a year ago, I simply cannot add more hours to my days, so I need to work smarter. I want to consolidate my business into one location!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have been a contract teacher for several community art schools in the area. I have cherished my time at these studios, but spend a lot of time on the road from one to another, back and forth to unload the kilns, etc. Again, in hopes of consolidating the different aspects of my business into one space, I am excited to pursue my own studio.</p>\n<p>This studio will&nbsp;be a destination studio and teaching space. It will be a great place to find a one of a kind piece of pottery, Jewelry, and art in the gallery space. As a working art studio, visitors will be able to view art being made daily. Adult and children’s ceramics and art education will be a major emphasis.\nIn addition, The Studio will be a destination on The Western Loudoun Artists Studio Tour and on the Loudoun Artisan Trail.\nThe studio will provide small intimate classes, professional instruction, and kiln firing services. It will be a active community art environment that will encourage tourism, online sales, drop in traffic and custom order pick up.\nClasses and instruction will be provided on an ongoing weekly schedule, as well as 1-time events, and private summer instruction for children&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I am crowd funding through KickStarter as a \"Pre-sale\" of some of my top selling items. The Pre-sale will help with the start up costs of the studio: Shelving, Tables, Kiln installation, and new equipment.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and interest, Please drop by to say hello and see the new digs if you are in the area!!</p>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The risks and challenges of this project are of course the overhead costs of the studio. Rent, electricity, kiln maintenance, and student supplies will be a constant expense that is built into my business plan. \r\n\r\nAs an independent artist it is challenging to make a living. I have found the combination of teaching, online sales, shows, and studio tours is a sustainable business model.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\"
