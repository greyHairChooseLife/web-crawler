We have met with the architect who is working on the official permit plans to submit to the city so we are ready to go on demolition and construction with the proper approvals in April. This will be a very exciting and welcome change to the space. Our new entry into the sales gallery area will allow for more natural light, and in the dead of winter, it's a great reminder as to how important daylight is for many of us!</p><p>REWARD UPDATES: <br><b>Anyone with a t-shirt as part of their reward:</b><br>It took MUCH longer than anticipated to get t-shirt size/color requests confirmed. There are still a couple of you we did not hear from after repeated emails, but we could not wait any longer, out of fear of being very late with our order!  We ordered extras in all sizes, but it won't be the ample color selection provided originally. We submitted the completed order for printing, and due to the holidays, they anticipate they will be printed and ready by early January, as the blank shirts have to be shipped to them for printing. Once we have the shirts on hand, we will contact people for pickup and mail the ones in which mail delivery was included.</p><p> <b>Anyone with a cup as part of their reward:</b>Cup rewards were originally set to be ready by January 2016 and we still anticipate that to be the case. Lee has made a number of them and has some more to complete before firing and glazing everything. If you do not have your color choice to us yet, please let us know! We have almost all those requests in, but are still missing one or two.</p><p><b>Original art rewards:</b><br>We have shipped out all original artworks or almost everyone local has picked theirs up or arranged for delivery, so we hope you will enjoy/are enjoying your works! For individuals with shipped works we just sent you a message with your tracking # as works were en route to you as of Monday 12/21.</p><p>Have a great holiday season and happy new year! We look forward to giving you more updates as we progress through this remodel.</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1447096288,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE0MDkzNTI=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Thank you!!!","publishedAt":1447096288,"pinnedAt":null,"number":4,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"The Clay Studio of Missoula","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/010/258/401/6a9c46a9da76357d3c73d1dd81c6a265_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461677026&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=7efd333daf1bb2f25a01a8ca8a968e69","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Our campaign officially ended this weekend and was successful at nearly 109% funded- $10,881.
