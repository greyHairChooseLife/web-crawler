you soon to figure out options.</p><p>I have been getting email notifications that pieces are being delivered, how exciting!!  I have gotten a report of a broken piece, so I have been re-packaging the ones that were going to be sent yesterday.  I hope they all make it to you safely!!  Please contact me if there are any issues.</p><p>Because I had trouble updating you through the website, you can
