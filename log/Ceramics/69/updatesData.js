The 200 amp service has been installed and\nthe kiln has been installed as well. As\na result, my pottery life has become so much easier, faster and more efficient!</p><p>Some of you may know that I took on a carpentry contract two\nweeks before my Jumping Creek Pottery Kickstarter Campaign reached it’s goal.  On March 21, I flew off to Cadiz Spain to\nbe a carpenteress on a cruise boat retrofit. My crew had an amazing job installing a Japanese restaurant on the top\nfloor of the ship.  It has been a fast,\nfurious and curious adventure, but I am so happy to be home to my quiet life in\nRevelstoke!</p><p>Prior to leaving for Spain, I was able to throw half of the\npots needed for my Kickstarter pledge and as of tomorrow, I will start making\nthe rest. When all the local pots are ready,\nI will open up my tiny house for pickup. The pots to be shipped I have slowly started shipping and will continue\nover the next few months.</p><p>Hope you are all enjoying this wonderful spring.</p><p>Take care, </p><p>Katy</p><p><a href=\"http://mailto:aintthatswell@hotmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">aintthatswell@hotmail.com</a></p><p>250-837-3597</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Kiln and feather bowls\" data-caption=\"Kiln and feather bowls\" data-id=\"3673161\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Kiln and feather bowls\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/673/161/1c321b1e7bd486ab9602ecd1e7c7ce67_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1429912505&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=fa57275c0bee66522c7cd29d82e70d40\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Kiln and feather bowls</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Cruise ship carpentry\" data-caption=\"Cruise ship carpentry\" data-id=\"3673194\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Cruise ship carpentry\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/673/194/618b010e7b260c7d39b370d388cfc186_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1429912879&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c833901bde020e713841070c080168c6\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Cruise ship carpentry</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jumpingcreekpottery.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.jumpingcreekpottery.com</a></p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1426120624,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"CAD","amount":"25000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"CAD","amount":"26229.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":215,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1425309922,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTExMzQ0Nzc=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Nine days left of Kickstarter Land","publishedAt":1425309922,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Kaitlan Murphy","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/360/009/4ff9d7d3baf3ab7d6f033b0a59dddf81_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461585262&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=fafeedfbc3ce6091e83a4107ca731cac","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>First off, THANK YOU for your support, I really appreciate your kindness and enthusiasm! </p><p>Twenty one days down and 9 to go! </p><p>Want to impress your friends with a Japanese dining experience?\nGet a FREE SAKE CUP!! </p><p>Nine days to go to our Kickstarter campaign and we need to\nraise $11,000</p><p>Please share this link to our campaign with all your arty\nfriends, bloggers friends, as well as your Facebook page and I will include a fresh and fun sake\ncup into your rewards! </p><p>Remember, Kickstarter is an ALL OR NOTHING campaign!</p><p>Have a great day. - Katy</p><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240474120/jumping-creek-pottery-studio-expansion?ref=category_location\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240474120/jumping-creek-pottery-studio-expansion?ref=category_location</a></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"3368234\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/368/234/e2da1e008ea71e23b39cd2c6c8aacbed_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1425309730&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=bf6b3d7109b81c21d4b84041bb40082a\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1423532220,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"CAD","amount":"25000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"CAD","amount":"26229.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":215,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
