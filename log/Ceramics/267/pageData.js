As a result of how difficult my condition became, I began working with clay as I couldn't return to my previous job.</p><p>That was roughly two years ago, and it's been pleasantly surprising realising how much people like my work. I've now been part of three Open Exhibitions, and have my own studio in Pie Factory Studios, Margate. I feel very lucky that I have found something that I can work on regardless of how my disability affects me and I would like to document this journey and hopefully give something back to the Ehlers Danlos community and to all who have helped me over the past two years.</p><p>I would like to put on an exhibition in my local area to raise awareness of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, and make what is currently an 'invisible' disability both visible and actual. To do this I need help to be able to purchase a disability friendly wheel (it's pretty much impossible for me to be able to use my manual one now), to complete setting up a modified studio so that I can fire larger items, produce at least three months work (which for someone with wandering joints takes just a 'little' bit longer than three months, hence me doing this way ahead of time!) and pay for materials, gallery, opening night and promotional costs. I have set my target based on what it will cost me to set up and produce one local exhibition; if by the efforts of you wondrous people this exceeds target, the further funding will go towards moving the exhibition around the country, to raise awareness of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome nationally.</p><p>I'm doing this via Kickstarter as I'm really hoping to make this a community experience. All donations will include an invitation to the opening night of the exhibition, and all Rewards have been thought out so as to include people in the exhibition in a very real and present way.</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this project, I am massively grateful to you. For those of you who choose to donate, you have my huge thanks and appreciation, and I hope very much to see you at the opening night (if we manage to hit target! :D )</p><p>All love,</p><p>Helen.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Rockpool Bowl\" data-caption=\"Rockpool Bowl\" data-id=\"4359695\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Rockpool Bowl\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/359/695/2fba65f7c7435c70c962fed881203d84_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1440234093&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ed411df403b51b0663a6d316ec954213\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Rockpool Bowl</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Vintage Heart\" data-caption=\"Vintage Heart\" data-id=\"4359698\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Vintage Heart\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/359/698/71cd271db4d59984fbc8a79771ba8528_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1440234167&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7c55a5b8d2cde139f6ceb84d8cde2c38\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Vintage Heart</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Rose Lacework Heart\" data-caption=\"Rose Lacework Heart\" data-id=\"4359697\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Rose Lacework Heart\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/359/697/7941537e8732d44a38b329969748f8a2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1440234140&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=42d7d507589a6859b32a779111d69ce1\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Rose Lacework Heart</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">My main challenge for this project will be my joints.

I began working with clay principally to strengthen my fingers but found that people liked the things I was making, and I began to be accepted for Open Exhibitions. So far in the past year I have been part of the Lovelys Gallery Open Exhibition, the York Street Gallery Open Exhibition and the Brighter Days Event organised by Pie Factory Gallery.\r\n\r\nI became fairly used to my 'misbehaving' joints and the pain that went along with them, but it was becoming ever more difficult to stand and walk as my hips and knees were becoming ever more unstable so I began to ask my lovely GP a host of very confusing questions.\r\n\r\nEventually I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a genetic mutation that causes weakness in collagen structure. As collagen is a 'building block' for all tissues in the body, this causes considerable difficulties for individuals who have it, and yet there is very little public awareness of it or just how debilitating it can be. I now have regular physiotherapy and hydrotherapy but I still have huge difficulties with nearly all mobility related activities; but I am adjusting to my disability, and am determined to improve my condition as much as possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, all of this has made me very aware of just how little known Ehlers Danlos Syndrome is, especially for a syndrome that has such far reaching effects. Ehlers Danlos can be life limiting as well as painful and debilitating, and I am determined to raise awareness of all sub types of Ehlers Danlos so that people can begin to see a disability that can often be 'invisible'.\r\n\r\nTo this end I am intending to put on a solo exhibition in June/July of next year, both using the skills that Ehlers Danlos has lent me (Ehlers Danlos also often confers unusual flexibility, which enables me to produce exceptionally detailed glaze work) and publicising a little known disability through ceramic work exploring the nature of invisible disabilities.\r\n\r\nI've been planning this for quite a while now, but to do it properly I need to finish setting up my disability friendly studio so that I can fire larger items and produce the equivalent of three months solid work for the exhibition, which as you can imagine, takes just a 'little' bit longer when your joints are somewhat prone to making extended travel plans. :) So I'm doing my best to get way ahead of the game, in as much as I ever can! \r\n\r\nIt's fair to say that Ehlers Danlos has altered the course of my life in permanent and not necessarily positive ways. But it has also led me to where I am now, and I want something very positive to come out of that. I know that I can create an exhibition that will hopefully do justice to the experiences of those living with this condition,and I also know that this has potential to raise awareness within my local community and also the wider community if I can raise enough to put the exhibition on in other locations.\r\n\r\nI honestly appreciate any and all donations to this project, and I have no expectations. I just know that it is something that I have to do, and that I will do everything I can to make it happen. I would love it to start from a community of interested parties,and I would love to share it with all of you on the opening night.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reading my enormously long explanation, and enormous thanks to anyone who chooses to be part of this.\r\n\r\nAll love,\r\n\r\nHelen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I am based in Margate, Kent","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Helen Whitehead","creator_last_login":1580095661,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":2,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.girlmadasbirds.com","domain":"girlmadasbirds.com"},{"url":"http://www.facebook.com/girlmadasbirds","domain":"facebook.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/010/216/271/c1c9c5f0a85c1f23154a681778c92225_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461674381&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=a867e11eefa2d88294d60c66a78a9f2e","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/883142608"}
