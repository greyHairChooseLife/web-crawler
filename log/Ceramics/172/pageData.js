My MFA in Studio Ceramics and success in additional figurative study gives me confidence in my ability to produce this new series. Having directed the Baum Gallery of Fine Art at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway for ten years, and having managed a statewide two-year traveling exhibit since retirement, I have a breadth of exhibit and logistics experience that will inform the tour process.  Having served as a community volunteer in various roles, I have learned how to communicate with stakeholders, staff persons, and participants in differing situations. Having authored exhibit essays and materials, grants, and public relations instruments for professional and volunteer projects, I am confident that I can organize tour feedback in a useful fashion.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I understand that successful projects benefit from scheduled input and assessment from trusted peers and collaborators.  I'm grateful for my Artist Inc. peer group that meets monthly: it has been a sounding board for this project from the get-go.  Fellow artists Virmarie DePoyster, Julie Holt, Elizabeth Webber, and Emily Wood have contributed sage advice, humor, and encouragement for \"And then, I...\"\r\n\r\n I'm also encouraged by having an Advisory Committee in place for this project: five women of various ages whose professional interests relate to the components of \"And then, I...\" and who have made valuable contributions to my research and will make valuable contributions as the project develops over time:\r\n\r\nSarah Beth Estes, Associate Professor of Sociology, Gender Studies Coordinator and Associate Dean, University of Arkansas at Little Rock\r\n\r\nDr. Deborah Kuster, Associate Professor of Art Education, Department of Art, University of Central Arkansas, Conway\r\n\r\nDr. Lenore Shoults, Executive Director of the Arts &amp; Sciences Center for Southeast Arkansas in Pine Bluff\r\n\r\nDr. Stephanie Vanderslice, Writing Professor, University of Central Arkansas, Director Arkansas Writers MFA Workshop</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xNzI4NDEwMjgy","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":8,"number_of_comments_depth_all":0,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nThis sculpture tour depicts moments in time that, combined with viewer feedback, creates a  final exhibit about art and story.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/722/131/5977b3b4ff725adb0a6236625defe11f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463687301&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=99b978524fe1bc1a0e67c8def32727be","last_updated":"September 15, 2014","project_name":"And then, I...\" Monuments to Pivotal Moment","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"5,400","amount_of_pledged":"5,525","number_of_backers":"56","rate_of_funded":102,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Conway, AR","creator_name":"Barbara Satterfield","creator_location":"Conway, AR","creator_description":"Barbara Satterfield has exhibited work in group shows and juried competitions since 1995, including the Arkansas Arts Center Delta Exhibition, Arts and Sciences Center for Southeast Arkansas, Fort Smith Regional Art Museum, Historic Arkansas Museum, The Galleries at Library Square, Fenix Gallery Fayetteville and the South Arkansas Arts Center.
