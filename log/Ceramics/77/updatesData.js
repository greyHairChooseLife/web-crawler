Classes were long, starting at 8am every morning and they would last until 6pm, but they were jam packed with information. I realized while there that I should take myself and my business more seriously if I want to succeed. There was a woman no older than me that was rocking everything and had the confidence to say so. It really inspired me to stop using my age and inexperience as a crutch. </p><div></div><div>Top three ideas I would like to implement: </div><div></div><p>1) I will be spending time turning my storefront into a cohesive image that I am proud of. This will include a larger wooden sign above my store, a sign inside my window that reads “Chestnut Studios” and a small sign above the door. I would like to print my hours from vinyl and adhere them to the door. I also hope to recreate a new open/close sign but this is low on the list.<br>2) I would like to become more comfortable with staying in contact with my email lists. Artist Tyler Voorhees at <a href=\"http://www.tylervoorheesart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tylervoorheesart.com/</a> does a great job of writing email campaigns that finish each section with a link to read more. This link, when clicked, sends the reader back to his website. This is GENIUS! Every time I end up there I continue looking through the rest of his work and finding artwork to buy. The instructor showed us tools to program posts to go out so we don’t have to stop every day to find content. I hope to use Sundays to schedule posts and send email updates to everyone.<br>3) Last but definitely not least, I would like to create molds of a dinnerware set so I can replicate it with ease. This would also come in handy when I decide to hire someone because if they don’t know the skill of wheel throwing, I can teach them how to fill molds and clean up the clay pieces when they take them out. Individual pieces are great and they have their place in everyone’s cabinet but I am ready to think bigger and like a ceramic business. </p><div></div><div>\n<p>I had a great time getting to know the seven women that went to the conference with me.

I have survived the ever exciting Svensk Hyllningsfest in Lindsborg and even got to experience Swedish Smorgasbord thanks to my shop property owner, Jim Prugh. What a treat that was! The first few months have been both exciting and terrifying as I try to balance running a store, keeping up with inventory and staying busy in the studio. There have been times I felt I had jumped the gun and didn’t yet have the skills as a ceramic artist to be selling my work. It’s quite a daunting task but the challenges have only made me stronger. I’ve learned to enjoy the task of setting up inventory displays, to relish the times that traffic is slow, and to stay the heck off Facebook when I should be staying productive. It really has been a blessing to have the shop and my studio in such a public area, as it gives me the perfect avenue to sell my work. Besides, each piece that I have sold has been technically sound and gets me one step closer to creating that stylish, cohesive dinner set that I’ve been dreaming about. </p><p> There are still a handful of kickstarter rewards that I have yet to send out, but please know, I haven’t forgotten about you! I won’t be firing my next kiln load until I have thrown each of the final pieces. I am so gracious for all your patience as I find my groove.  There are a few folks yet that I haven’t received your address to send your gift to, if you could email me at chestnutstudioslbk@gmail.com, I will ship them out soon! I hope as you receive your rewards, as you unpack your ceramics from all that bubble wrap and extra boxes of love, you experience the joy I had in creating each piece for you. I also really hope that each piece speaks to your style and personality, as a handmade piece of ceramics should. I try to think of a form and glaze each of you would like and channel that into my throwing practice. I want each piece to connect you and me every time you use it to fill with coffee, to use with dinner, to use as decoration, or however you use it. </p><p> In the meanwhile, I have been working on a website and would love your feedback if you’d like to give it. I have included my ceramics for sale on it and also a description of all the lovely artists that trust me to sell their merch. The website is <a href=\"http://www.chestnutstudioslbk.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.chestnutstudioslbk.com</a> and was built using <a href=\"http://wix.com\" target=\"_blank\">wix.com</a>. I am working on tying an email newsletter to the website and will be adding your emails to that list soon. I’m hoping to streamline the lines of communication so I can spend more time in the studio and less time on the internet. Please let me know if you’d like to stay off the newsletter list, otherwise – I’ll see you there! If I haven’t seen you in the shop yet, I hope I get to see you there soon! Pictures really don’t do the space justice (I’m still working on that one :p). </p><p>Until next time, Christi Becker<br>Chestnut Studios </p><p> Oh! And one last thing, I have been gifted the opportunity to go with a group a fellow business owners from Lindsborg to a business conference in Longmont, CO. It’s a no-nonsense conference, called Destination Bootcamp and starts next Monday evening. It is filled with classes all the way until Thursday afternoon and we will be traveling back that night. NetworkKansas is sponsoring our conference fee so we just have to pay travel and food. A big shout out to Holly Lofton of the Lindsborg CVB and Kathy Richardson at the Small World Gallery for getting everything lined up for us to go. Without them, it wouldn’t have been possible. Thank you! I’m hoping to learn techniques to create a destination shopping experience within my store, and also how to help my community continue branding themselves as “Little Sweden.” Wish me luck! </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1434662272,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEyNjEyNzk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Open for Business!","publishedAt":1434662272,"pinnedAt":null,"number":7,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Christi Becker","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/595/223/b7cd30e12791ff2d4cd9148a3d2c27bf_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461605533&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=84a4ad99cbf997299c80b6bd007a7ad4","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Opening Day!\" data-caption=\"Opening Day!\" data-id=\"4006413\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Opening Day!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/006/413/7ec38b3367a119277f1a500955bc427d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1434661222&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=fcd4f42734f17d6c60e4a630c66bd873\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Opening Day!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The grand opening has come and gone and the store is now\nopen for business!

There was not a single piece that I\nhated (a rare occasion for a perfectionist like myself). The necklace piece\nbelow was the first thing I saw and I was thrilled with how it came out. To\nmake this, I laid a disk over a seashell and let it set up before bisque firing\njust the clay. In the glaze firing, I layered chunks of glass inside and let it\ndo its thing. I was worried that the glass would run over the edge but it came\nout perfect! I am so excited to be sending these as gifts. </p><p>Yesterday, I was able to peak at the progress on the store.\nIt is coming along at great speeds! The contractor was pleasantly surprised at\nthe condition of the hardwood floors under the carpet and will be able to\nquickly refurbish it.
