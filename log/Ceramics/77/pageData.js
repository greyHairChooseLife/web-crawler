Since then, I&nbsp;have been working as the Administrative Assistant to their Art Department (man, that's a mouthful, bare with me), book-keeper for a small antique, metalsmithing studio and handmade gift store, and bartending a few nights a week to help make ends meet.  During my \"free time,\" I have been building a personal ceramic studio in my laundry room. I have spent many hours hunched over a potters wheel, obsessing over a lump of clay from a ball to cup, all the way through two separate but necessary kiln firings.  During the last month of&nbsp; college, through all the crazy hustle bustle of finishing classes, I had the pleasure of hosting a senior exhibition and almost selling out of all the artwork I had created.  It was very humbling and exhilerating to see people's faces react as they looked over my work and found something that spoke to them.  As I was looking around after all the guests had left, I began realizing how possible it was to create art for a living.  All those little red \"sold\" stickers screamed encouragement and helped confirm my decision to become an artist making accessible, functional ceramics.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Here's the shop from the inside!

This will be a great experiment for me! If my\nestimation falls over $10, I will refund you the cost when I ship your product\nto you. The projected ship date is also possibly over estimated as I wanted to\nallow for plenty of time to create the work, fire the pieces twice, and get the\nwork in the mail. I appreciate your patience as I work through these new\nexperiences!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Coming soon to this store front!\" data-caption=\"Coming soon to this store front!\" data-id=\"3465252\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Coming soon to this store front!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/465/252/54773e62cc1c51ced7b5f97acfc1651d_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1426737174&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9a88fdebcfd973632a402a58daa9c10f\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Coming soon to this store front!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Fresh out of the kiln on March 16th!\" data-caption=\"Fresh out of the kiln on March 16th!\" data-id=\"3465257\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Fresh out of the kiln on March 16th!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/465/257/a321e4bd54ce4a3dad0e7bbb1bf23b85_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1426737257&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d55c7fe1920d9d4c80816c6a7b3b265a\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Fresh out of the kiln on March 16th!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Here's an example of a pitcher and tumbler set :)\" data-caption=\"Here's an example of a pitcher and tumbler set :)\" data-id=\"3468608\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Here's an example of a pitcher and tumbler set :)\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/468/608/9b2fcd1c1e0fd716cc980bc44012af8b_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1426797968&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=33f4cca2c33ce2e014488fcae7f8e90b\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Here's an example of a pitcher and tumbler set :)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">An obstacle I will be dodging is that the store location I am going to rent will have slight modifications to the building before I can move in. The prospective Grand Opening date is May 1st, but may have to wait until the renovations are complete.  The improvements made by the property owner include an ADA approved bathroom, tearing out a wall that creates a lot of dead space, and removing old carpet to replace it with hardwood floors. I'm thrilled to rent this location and will wait until the perfect time to move in and begin business.\r\n\r\nI will be utilizing the month I have before opening Chestnut Studios to build up my ceramic inventory and work on the rewards for investing in my company.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xNzA2OTgyMTA2","number_of_FAQ":3,"number_of_updates":9,"number_of_comments_depth_all":2,"contents_of_FAQ":["<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_127299\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"127299\" href=\"#project_faq_127299\" name=\"project_faq_127299\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nIf you don't reach your $3,500 goal, do you get to keep what IS pledged?\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>Unfortunately, no.
