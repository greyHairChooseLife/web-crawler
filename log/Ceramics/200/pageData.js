How we get up in the morning and get ready, our nightly routine, the way we drive to work.&nbsp; We are creatures of habit.&nbsp; I am a creature of habit, in my life and in my art.&nbsp; Yet, I enjoy how even when I do the same thing over and over again, it is never the same.&nbsp; I'm talking about how even when I throw the same form on the wheel and I look at it, they are different because they hold so much different potential in each piece.&nbsp; I cut and reassemble turning the pieces and flipping them around so that each vessel is unique and different.&nbsp; And then, even when I stick them in the kiln these crazy twisting, turning pieces get beautiful, unpredictable atmospheric qualities.&nbsp; So much of what I love about what I do, I love about the Japanese aesthetics. </p><p>My project is aimed at getting me and my art out of my normal \"pattern\" and experiencing the art of making in Japan.&nbsp; I want to be inspired and influenced by Japanese potters in Okinawa and grow personally in creating in this new environment.&nbsp; </p><p>With your funds, I will fly to Japan and rent studio space at a local pottery.&nbsp; There I will continue exploring all the many possibilities in these cut and reassembled forms.&nbsp; I will use the money to help pay for the studio fees including fees for studio space, firing, and materials.&nbsp; I plan on visiting as many studios and galleries as possible and experiencing the culture of Japan so that it soaks into my daily life and into my art. I thank you so very much for all of your support and encouragement!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The main challenge for my project is finding a studio that has an available opening and that can communicate effectively on both ends.

I grew up in a military family and have traveled around the United States, but would love to experience the world. I am absolutely passionate about creating my ceramics and wouldn't know what to do if I wasn't making art. My family is creative in many ways including cooking, quilting, music, and of course the visual arts.\r\n\r\nMy work stems from an obsessive addiction to pattern.  It started from wanting to \"quilt\" my clay back together after cutting it apart and developed into this complex system of reconstructed deconstruction, a flipping and turning of pieces to create new silhouettes and forms.  I want to entice the viewer to want to look inside by putting the outside on the inside and the inside on the outside.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1635975801,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":3,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://karithornton.weebly.com","domain":"karithornton.weebly.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/339/714/39af072da69fd2e48d0372b9cc6c45fe_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461582307&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=4967961d097bfb961ea2c37497fdd6ce","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/2070996038","top_cities_location_1st":"Springfield United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"4","top_cities_location_2st":"Laurel United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"3","top_cities_location_3st":"Peoria United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"3","top_cities_location_4st":"Chicago United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"2","top_cities_location_5st":"Fredonia United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"2","top_cities_location_6st":"Worcester United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"St.-Hilaire-de-Voust France","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Bellingham United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Charleston United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Decatur United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"28","top_countries_location_2st":"France","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_countries_location_3st":"United Kingdom","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","number_of_new_backers":25,"number_of_returning_backers":6}
