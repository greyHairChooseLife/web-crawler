I tend to be eclectic, and want to do all the things! So in my studies I have kept trying mediums that are new to me.

Art for me is a true expression without interruption, and without filtering.\r\n\r\nI am a recent graduate from Temple College with an Associate of Arts Degree in Art.

I also care for my mother with Alzheimer's at home. I am in the process of setting up a home ceramics studio, and working off a limited budget. I have purchased a small kiln and pottery wheel.  I’ve got 100lbs of clay, and have started building. The main things I need right now are  a few other materials and glazes. So what I am looking for is a bit of help. I am trying to raise an additional $700 (the glazes vary from $12 -$25 a pint and I have my eye on about 20 of them) Most of my projects use two glazes, and this would allow for a greater variety. I have eight that were purchased for my class projects. Most were small amounts and are mostly gone. Thank you for your consideration!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I am in the process of enclosing a portion of our back patio to use as a studio. The Kiln. Wheel, and other accessories I already have are boxed just waiting to be opened like Christmas morning. Once the studio is ready, I will start to work throwing the reward pieces. With different conditions than at the classroom of the college, and taking care of mom. I will have some adjustments to make to learn (given the work space, environment, &amp; time available) how much I can get done, the drying time, and other aspects for project timelines. Once I have all that down. I can work on firing, glazing, and re-firing the reward pieces.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":1,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nCeramic Bowl\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A ceramic bowl personally thrown by me.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-12-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Dec 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n9 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>"],"number_of_FAQ":"0","number_of_updates":"7","number_of_comments_depth_all":"0","contents_of_FAQ":[],"top_cities_location_1st":"Austin United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"1","top_cities_location_2st":"Concord United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_cities_location_3st":"Harker Heights United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_cities_location_4st":"Keota United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_cities_location_5st":"Layton United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_cities_location_6st":"Los Angeles United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Nashville United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Philadelphia United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Seattle United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Temple United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"11","number_of_new_backers":2,"number_of_returning_backers":9,"last_updated":"June 16, 2017"}
