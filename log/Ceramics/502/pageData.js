After years in the corporate world I decided to share my true love of art and function with others. I love creating colorful, whimsical, and functional pieces and find inspiration everywhere. I create items that I feel have function with designs that excite me. I also create custom pieces for your home, birthdays, or special events.\r\n\r\nI love color and patterns and whimsical fonts and often my pieces are created to reflect my passion. I love the ocean, holidays, architecture and fairy tales. I believe in karma and good deeds. I love casual walks through crafts stores, art exhibitions, and flipping through magazines to see new fun patterns and designs that can help me create one-of-a-kind pieces!","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Desirae DeBellis","creator_last_login":1595860315,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":3,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.etsy.com/shop/DabaDos/","domain":"etsy.com"},{"url":"http://www.facebook.com/DabaDos","domain":"facebook.com"},{"url":"http://www.twitter.com/DabDos","domain":"twitter.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/606/283/c34da7c28133bf57867f4ed2c835cd42_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461606211&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=066c2909303bf298d6e5d3afa48a4993","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/924087060","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><h3 id=\"h:about-me-and-my-fund\" class=\"page-anchor\">About me and my Fundraiser!</h3> <p>Hello, my name is Desirae. I\n have been a crafter since I can remember. I have always donated my hand\n made wares to others and charitable groups as I have often made more \nitems than I could personally use. Since November 2014, I have been \nunemployed. Having applied to many jobs and having no luck, I have \ndecided to bring my passion of color and ceramics to others and start my\n own business as a means to support my family. I have made 3 sales so \nfar in the last two weeks, but I'm not able to produce the inventory I \nneed to be successful fast enough or at a cost that is profitable \nbecause I do not have my own kiln.&nbsp; I also would love to share my craft \nwith others through lessons and donate my services to schools in my \nlocal area by hosting free ceramic classes to those that can not afford \nto learn about this wonderful art form, and eventually open my own \nstudio.&nbsp; At this time I am driving 20 minutes away and paying someone \nelse to fire my pieces. This has reduced my profit to pennies on the \ndollar. </p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to visit my shop on Etsy to see some of my pieces @ <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/shop/DabaDos\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.etsy.com/shop/DabaDos</a></p>\n\n <div> <h3 id=\"h:what-i-need-and-what\" class=\"page-anchor\">What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What I need:</p>\n<p>A new kiln cost $2343.00 w/o tax. The stilts and posts that I would \nneed\n to operate the kiln cost around $300.00 and the estimate for an \nelectrician to install it is $300.00. Total cost $3000.00 + crowdfunding fees = $3200.00 - all the \nmoney I receive will go towards purchasing a kiln. </p>\n<br> Because you are funding a kiln so that I can provide for my family \nand start my business, I would like to thank you by creating a unique \npiece for you. I specialize in unique, hand painted functional pieces. I\n produce plates, mugs, bowls, and many more pieces that are just as \nbeautiful as they are functional. <br><br>\n<p>Where will this money go anyway?</p> <ul>\n<li>All of the money will go to purchase and setup a kiln. <br>\n</li>\n<li>Any\n money that goes over the goal amount will go towards marketing my Etsy store, glazes, and supplies. </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n</div> <div> <h3 id=\"h:the-impact\" class=\"page-anchor\">The Impact</h3>By helping me purchase a kiln, you will provide me with the means to do the following:<br><br>* Provide for my family<br>* Become profitable and successful doing something I love<br>* Allow me to share my love of art and ceramics with others through their purchases<br>*Provide classes and teach children about art and ceramics<br>\n</div> <div>\n<p>Please Note: The cost of shipping will also dictate when I am able to\n ship your item.

So I will be purchasing one one way or another. This fundraiser will help me get it quicker. All art does take time to create, so once this fundraiser has taken off, I will begin work on the Rewards based on the order that people donated. \r\n\r\nPlease Note: The cost of shipping will also dictate when I am able to ship your item.
