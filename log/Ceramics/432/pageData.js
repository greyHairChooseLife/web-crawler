CPS will operate at a maximum capacity of 240 students, which will be broken into four 8 – week sections six times per year. An initial estimated quota is 80% for Camden residents and 20% for participants from surrounding communities, with a priority on local slots. 50 slots will be reserved for talented high school students from Camden. Out of 2200 high school students in Camden, only 385 can be potentially involved in specialized art programs at Morgan Village Creative Arts Academy (a number is even smaller for students interested in visual arts), and we propose to create an opportunity for uninvolved talented students interested in visual arts, to pursue their interests through our program.Through the use a renovated gallery space students and local artists can display to network their work.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15122748\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/122/748/cef832099c9dc842adf75a651339bdf8_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1484070119&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6f45a72f6b398d7567f961344c0c1884\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>The second goal of this expansion is to install a working professional gallery at the Benson Street location to show work of participants in PFS programs and work of local and regional artists. The gallery will be a unique opportunity to meet and mingle with art students at the college level as well as members of the NJ visual arts community. They will also be offered help organizing their portfolios for future shows, gallery consideration, or college entrance reviews. Not only is this a unique opportunity for students it would also be a great opportunity for Ceramic Pie as a local business.  We hope that PFS programs will help us to become increasingly known in the region, allowing to expand into paid courses in painting, pottery, ceramics, sculpture, and silkscreen production, attracting local business development. The PFS programs will be constantly reviewed on the ongoing basis throughout the year, with the final review in the end of the year, to determine the future of the Ceramic Pie Studios. \n The funds requested cover a series of improvements that will help us better achieve our goals.  These expenses include a salary for an art director managing everyday operations of the program, a part-time teachers’ assistant salary, a supplies’ budget covering all of the materials, and a projected utility consumption cost.  There is a part of the budget allotted for overall renovation and reconstruction of gallery space. In addition, the budget includes equipment costs for tools needed for ceramics and pottery courses.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15122810\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/122/810/2620b207d6bc7a71b4c4a97a37d954f7_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1484070417&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=af82c6882aa5a57f3f9e2d4958dae517\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>    The third goal of funding is to acquire land for a sculpture/milk thistle  garden adjacent to the current location to serve as a community landmark and assist the monarch butterfly on its normal migration route. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15122820\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/122/820/27886b3c08ae4eaffc22c8b453fbbcc8_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1484070456&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=28da715c392bf3afc27bb29c37d28dbd\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The challenges of organization would be the biggest hurdle in getting Ceramic Pies Studios in place but plans are already on the books to bring in outside counsel for all of our organizational needs.
