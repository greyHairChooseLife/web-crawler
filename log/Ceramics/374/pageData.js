This is our 3rd launch to bring hope and healing through the arts to the inner city of Minneapolis.&nbsp;</p><p>But we cannot do this without the support of people like you who see the healing power of the arts.

In order to become of value to the community the church is being refitted to offer arts in education and arts in therapy to bring hope and healing. \r\n\r\nThe greatest hurdles are the initial launch, community awareness, and much need art supplies and materials along with the funds to scholarship the less fortunate. The intent of the arts outreach center is to offer 100% scholarships to the less fortunate in the inner city of Minneapolis. This includes one of the largest Native American Communities in a metropolitan area of its kind called Little Earth. We also serve a large Somali community, Hispanic community, and Mung community. We also open our doors to at risk and troubled youth.\r\n\r\nThe facilities are debt free but fine art and visual art supplies and materials along with the equipment are expensive. To give away our time, treasure, and talent to those who have less we will need to build and continue to build a donor base within the philanthropic community that believe in the power of healing through the language of art. \r\n\r\nThe existing church facilities give us property and facilities but as this is a significant cultural shift from a member based church to a donor based nonprofit for the arts it takes time, PR, marketing, developing community awareness, along with the donor base, and qualifying potential foundations and grants for the arts. We can make it happen with your belief and support.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 150</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 150</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Wheel thrown pottery mugs, stoneware.
