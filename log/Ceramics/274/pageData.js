But in my later years of childhood, I did not touch it.  Instead, I began to paint and spent my days after work painting.  After years of living and traveling abroad, (I spent twelve years teaching English in Mexico and Japan), I came back to clay.  After my daughter was born my family moved back to the Portland area where I grew up.  When we arrived, I immediately bought a pottery wheel- even before getting a car.  Since then, most of my extra money and time has gone into building the studio and working with clay .  Sometimes children will come to play and I teach them the wheel, just because it's so fun for them.  This last school year I brought my studio to a school for at risk students and I promised myself I would try to do it again.  My old worn out wheel broke down and that is why I am doing Kickstarter (thank you for your support).  Working with children has been a blessing, and I am seeing where it takes me.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1435917915,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://kevinsplace.com/","domain":"kevinsplace.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/097/558/37a9018527bd751f1d90a9884199b933_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461557943&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=a35f807bb8cd47ebc9dda7852bf7723e","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/868423974","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Last year I had a great time teaching students in a pottery workshop at a school for at-risk children, but one of my pottery wheels broke down on the last day. &nbsp;I wasn't sad, because everyone had such a great time (this is also where I worked as a paraeducator sub for special education classrooms.) &nbsp;It was worth it, but I may have to replace the pottery wheel. &nbsp;Next year, I plan to go back to the same school with more wheels. &nbsp;I would like to buy two wheels with the money raised, and use the other part of the money to improve my studio so that it is safer (I need air purification) for children. &nbsp;I may even be able to enclose the patio and set up the studio there so kids can have more room to learn pottery.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">No risks other than to my pride, but I can overcome anything with a little help from my friends.
