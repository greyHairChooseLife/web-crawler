Thank you all so very much for supporting us in our effort to touch the lives of others though the use of Earth, Water, Wind and Fire. </p><p>We have decided to follow the example of traditional Japanese pottery villages so that the pieces of pottery that leave the kiln are not the work of any particular artisan.  The person who throws the clay is just as important as the person who fires the kiln, the person who chopped the firewood, the person who cooked the meals, and the many people who provided the financial backing to make everything possible.  The ceramics that have left the kiln over the past year has been an expression of many people's zen training. </p><p>The name for the ceramics made and fired at our Zen Dojo is called <i>Chosei Yaki</i>.  Who made <i>Chosei Yaki</i>?  We all did including yourselves.  For this we are very grateful.\n\n </p><p>So far we have filled-up and fired the kiln four times.  The first few times we fired the kiln it became very obvious that we had much more to learn about firing a traditional anagram wood-fired kiln and more to learn about mixing the glazes as well.  Very little of what came out of the first two firings were up to the standards that we wish to uphold.  </p><p>Thank you all for your patience in receiving what was promised by us.  We believe that we have fulfilled all of the orders and obligations to our financial backers.  If you have not received what you were expecting or if anything arrived broken or defective please let us know and we will be sure to make it right.\n\nWe wish to have more bowls, plates, and cups on hand soon for sale.  So if you liked what you received or know of someone who would like to have some of the ceramics that have been made by the kiln that you helped to build, please let us know and we will try and have more ceramics on-hand soon… </p><p>However you will need to be patient with us once again.  Apparently we have much more to learn about building roofs over kilns as well.  Unfortunately this fall while building a roof over the kiln, there was a design flaw - not enough structural bracing.  Long story short, the roof collapsed. The chimney fell down and there was substantial damage to the main body of the kiln.  A good portion of the kiln will need to be carefully taken apart, repaired, and rebuilt.  It is too cold to do that work this winter but we hope to have all of this work done and our next firing by the middle of next June.\n\nOnce again thank you for being a part of <i>Chosei Yaki</i>.  Thank you for supporting the Zen training of the many students who have been a part of the process.  Thank you for your patience and support. </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Scott Kiel, Zen student and director of the <i>Chosei-yaki</i> program </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1520356969,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIxMzAyMzQ=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Blessing of the New Kiln and First \"Cone 10\" Firing","publishedAt":1520356969,"pinnedAt":null,"number":6,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Rebecca Ryan","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/324/956/5a376d032948abf16052ba7d3d00b711_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1506086249&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=e98c7e3dacb8e48d7ce59e90b34a62d4","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":8,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Friends,</p><p>We're very happy to share <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/GKzzmy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this video</a> of the blessing of our kiln, and <a href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHsmbRvpkN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photos</a> from it's first \"Cone 10\" firing.
