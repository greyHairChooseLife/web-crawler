I have the nicest neighboring businesses that are always telling people about my shop and giving away my coupons and flyers.

It has not been with out its challenges, but I will say- this really has been a dream come true! Thanks so much for all the love, patience and support! I would not be where I am today if it weren't for your help in backing this project. Thank you a million times over!
