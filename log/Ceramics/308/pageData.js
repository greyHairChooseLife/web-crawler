Of course you did! &nbsp;It’s only the hottest (and coolest) new thing going but where exactly do you find a place to practice pottery? &nbsp;And even once you do find a place why do you have to wait for a year to take a class?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Well my friend, this is your amazingly special chance to support a new studio opening up in South Austin and <span class=\"bold\">get priority access for 1 or 2 years or more</span> (for as low as $150 donation). &nbsp;Or you can just get yourself a cool t-shirt and an amazing buddha bowl for $50 who doesn't want that?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have not ever been inside an actual clay studio you are truly missing out on a <span class=\"bold\">very special experience unlike anything you will have known before</span>. It is a true zen experience that creates a send of peace and tranquility as well as instant camaraderie among fellow pot makers.</p>\n<p>However, At Tex Zen students will not just being learning the basics of pottery. &nbsp;Actually, they will be thoroughly exposed to the <span class=\"bold\">basics of zen mindfulness practice using clay</span> as the medium: centering, balance, forms of awareness, subtle chi energy, key elements of feng shui are just a few of the skills to be learned. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zen Master Nick Cedarleaf, author of the Path of Happy Heart &amp; other mindfulness self help books, is moving his complete existing rural east Texas pottery studio facility to the greater South Austin area (as soon as August if the funding goal is reached). This is already a true working clay studio. &nbsp;However in Austin it will be ramping up to start producing a complete catalog of TexZen pieces that will be for sale in the public gallery, online and in high end locales throughout Austin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More importantly for you, the TexZen Pottery &amp; Mindfulness Studio will also be <span class=\"bold\">a complete educational facility</span> that will be expanding to 8 throwing wheels &amp; 3 kilns with 5+ class per week @ 8-10 students per each class (that's only 50 slots every 2 months folks!) . In addition to classes there will also be weekly drop in open studio hours to master your skills and meet and greet other students / members.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, and perhaps most important of all, there will be an<span class=\"bold\"> exclusive TexZen Mindfulness club</span>. (Available instantly to $500+ donors otherwise only for an annual fee to students who complete the first 2 classes). &nbsp;Members of the club will be able to use the studio during off hours for additional meet and greets, daily tea/coffee chats, weekly meditation hours, private BBQs and more. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Intro Classes</span></p>\n<p>Here are the initial 8 levels of 8 session courses (this is a 2 year program that will cost @ $400 / class or $3200 total to public so you can save 40% by becoming an early patron)</p>\n<p>1- Intro to Zen of Clay “centering yourself in the 5 elements”</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>earth / clay&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>water / fluidity</li>\n  <li>metal / wood</li>\n  <li>air / drying</li>\n  <li>fire / transformation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2 - Intermediate Shapes and Balance - “perfecting the buddha bowl”</p>\n<p>3 - Advanced Forms of self reflection - “I am a little tea pot using cyclical forces for goodness”</p>\n<p>4 - Creating Water / Storage Vessels - “the cool chi energies of water”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 - Throwing in Series - “striving for perfect imperfectness”</p>\n<p>6 - Glaze mixing - “mastering colors for great feng shui”</p>\n<p>7 - Kiln Firing - “the hot chi energies of fire”</p>\n<p>8 - Clay &amp; Rock Hunting - “creating naturally balanced clays and glazes”</p>\n<br>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Advanced Cirriculum</span></p>\n<p>Students who complete the initial 8 courses will be qualified to advance to higher level cirriculum as well as Zen Master Clay Jedi training.

Several locations have already been scouted but they may not be available by the time the funds are in place.  A centrally located location will be chosen (for maximum availability to students) with rent between $3000-4000 and min of 1000 square feet.  The location also needs to be able to handle proper ventilation for dust &amp; kiln heat as well as special water setup.\nMost everything else is ready to go as this is already a completely functioning studio  and educational facility.  Nick may need to sleep on some kind folks couches until he finds the proper apartment in the city to match the studio's location :)\nIf the project is fully funded there will be like 200 buddha bowls to make so that will take up to 2 months to produce until the new larger kiln is purchased and in place.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":9,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSigned Copy of Path of Happy Heart\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>This is my 22 step mindfulness book available on amazon.
