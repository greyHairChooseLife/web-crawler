I’ve been living simply and firing with wood and waste vegetable oil in the kiln in the video named the Tin Man, but last summer, I had to take him apart and move.  So now I’m in a new studio in the country, still working with porcelain but firing in a small electric kiln instead.  I’ve been making fermenting crocks and selling them at Portland Homestead Supply.  For the first time, I’m experiencing a high demand for my work, so I’m ready for a bigger electric kiln.  The one that I have is awkwardly small for large crocks and it recently had a major malfunction.  Plus a kiln with a computer controller would use energy more efficiently, which is something that I value highly.  Already the work is powered as much as possible by solar energy.  I’d like to offer something made in as carbon-neutral a way as possible. </p><p>I’d like to tell you a little bit about the fermentation process that happens in the crocks because it does increase the nutritional availability of the food.  We all know about sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso.  Those very healthy foods are fermented in a jar or crock.  Its an anaerobic process in which beneficial bacteria break down the food for you so that more of the vitamins and minerals are available to your body once your own digestive system starts to work on it.  I’m a true believer because I see the effects in my own health.  I have noticed and I’ve heard from others who use my crocks that they work really well and there’s never any mold growing on the top.  I’m sure that is because of the water seal here at the top, which is the German design.  I like to think of mine as the BMW of crocks because they are not just made to the highest technical specification, but they are also beautiful and satisfying to touch.</p><p>My project is to further my ability to be an independent professional potter but I have fun stuff to offer in the short term.   My budget is 2800 for the kiln itself, a Skutt 1227, 660 for kiln furniture, 330 for tax, and 2/3rds remaining is to account for reward production costs at a living wage, shipping, and handling. I can break it down further if you'd like: basically, I am getting too old to settle for less than a living wage, so for all the items that I've offered, I ask 15/ hr to make them.&nbsp; This is not digital reproduction, and it is not made in China, bless their overworked hearts.</p><p>I have a variety of goals, one among them is to get my pots into restaurant use, and I have taken concrete steps towards that.  So you’ll see that one reward is to enjoy dinner with me at Biwa restaurant in Portland, or a ticket to a quarterly Japanese Kaiseki supper club that uses my dishes as their service.   Another way that I am working and collaborating is in industrial design with Mudshark studios.  So one reward is for a Mermaid Cup that is my first experiment in having a production studio replicate my popular mug design.  That first edition was for 500 mugs, and they sold at New Seasons Market in the Portland area.  And if you go to my website <a href=\"http://Fire-Keeper.org\" target=\"_blank\">Fire-Keeper.org</a>, you will see photos on the home page of the well-loved Research Club Brunch Box fired in the Tin Man.  Designed as a classy but portable way to reduce paper waste, the Brunch Box has been featured at Research Club brunches many times.  All of these projects have a cumulative effect on my professional capacity.  I am poised to bring quality handmade porcelain to the Portland dining scene, and my crocks to your kitchen as a tool for greater digestive health.</p><p>Many thanks for your help!!<br> </p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Well, I think the biggest challenge might come from the fact that I am already over-booked on my time, so I'd be trying to keep my retailer stocked with crocks for the harvest season while fulfilling the obligations of the campaign.  When my existing kiln had a technical failure, it set me back, and then the kickstarter for a new kiln would set me back on short-term time while also allowing me to leap forward in the long term.  All the items listed as rewards have been accurately priced out because they've been made at a living wage and shipped before, other than the zine.  I just took a stab at the zine cost, but the rest should be realistic.  \r\nThis is my first campaign, so I'm a little surprised at the fact that for me to earn a living wage doing this, the budget to fulfill the rewards puts me asking 2/3 of what I need from the campaign to begin with.  That feels odd to me.  $5570 is needed to fill the rewards (while having a \"profit\" from each that goes towards the kiln).  I only need 3500 to buy the kiln.  I guess that kind of thing is deemed normal... I understand in principal, and look forward to seeing exactly what happens.  If there's something I'm not catching here, do let me know.. thanks..</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":11,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>thank you card made by myself and the delightful children of the tribe that seems to have adopted me</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-09-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sep 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 13</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 13</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A little zine of favorite ferments that I've made over the past few years: \"morning salads\" that are my chlorophyll boost, licorice madness, pineapple kimchi, beets for killer borscht, etc.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-12-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Dec 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 18</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 18</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A porcelain weight stone that fits in a wide-mouth mason jar.
