 I have begun production, and have been very busy on the wheel since February.  My kiln (Brigitte Rose) is hooked up, and is literally cooling down right now following her second glaze firing.  I am thrilled with this amazing machine, and am sure it will take years before I know all of her capabilities!  On the nitty gritty studio build side, we have installed counters and a proper clay prep station, as well as plumbed in a new sink with a clay trap and pump for properly dealing with clean up.  It is not fully functional yet, but as the weather gets warmer, I don't mind the regular trips to the outdoors to clean my trays, sponges and tools.  But I certainly look forward to that functional space!  We are also looking at putting in more shelving for drying pots, and for storing bisqueware waiting to be glazed.  </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"drying shelves...\" data-id=\"32901376\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/901/376/7a717fc0e3838a549b0052bda8a7223c_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1616886813&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9319e00912b681ed7d8f4959652fa2f5\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">drying shelves...</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Work on the Shopify site has been progressing, and as I build that space online, my excitement to share it grows as well!  I hope to launch that site at the end of April.  On April 24th I hope to have some sort of in-person launch, but with Covid this might not be possible.  I really hope to meet many of my backers, and people that have shown so much support in my journey whom I have yet to meet!  </p>\n<p>I know that the promised pre-purchased Signature Mugs would be ready in September, but I was secretly hoping that I might have them ready for my launch in April.  I have had to take a step back from that 'dream' and realize that this might not be possible as I am trying to build inventory for launch date.  I do hope to have all of the Signature mugs ready by late spring!  And don't worry, not one Signature mug will be sold before all of my backers receive their pledged mug!  </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"three signature mugs ready...\" data-id=\"32901351\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/901/351/925a7b5d01cabc09ee590404f56fa717_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1616886657&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7c4f5f569c20c43abc7302606857c0dc\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">three signature mugs ready...</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I am currently busy making vases, bowls, pasta plates/bowls, variety of mugs, spoon rests, mushrooms and candle lanterns!
