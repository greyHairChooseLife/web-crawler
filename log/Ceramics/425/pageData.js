Seeing as how he's in a wheelchair and doesn't have the greatest control of his hands, he wasn't sure how it was possible, but I had faith that we could work it out and get dirty in the process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We tried a bunch of techniques, had some successes and failures, but then finally landed on a process that worked well for both of us. We made some bowls, showed them off to people and one person fell in love with one of our bowls and asked if it was for sale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That one sale was the impetus to Fondle These Bowls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Months of planning and a series of happy accidents brought us together in our friend's garage as a studio space. With a borrowed kiln, we set out to see if we had what it takes to create a viable business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through a ton of positive feedback and so very much trial and error we have finally done it! We finally have the tools, supplies and techniques to consistently and in a timely manner create beautiful bowls people love to touch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here's where you come in:</p>\n<p>The technique we use is slab rolling coupled with slump molds. You don't need to know what those terms mean, but here's an image to show you what it looks like.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27318921\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/318/921/b63bf0b177c832b967bcbc8d4ecdc54d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574542761&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b79c1b470ce3d0e5807daef8f78cfdee\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The most physically demanding part of this process is wedging the clay (think of kneading dough). Wedging does a few things, but the main part of it is that it removes air pockets that can cause the clay to explode in the first kiln firing and/or lead to weakness that would lead to ultimate failure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm working on my strength, but even at my best the wedging process is hard on my arms and back which effects our product turn around time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With this Kickstarter we are looking to purchase a pug mill.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27292130\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/292/130/709c94360429a4816c28d827997cb496_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574331399&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4ba269f1d97f5224bcb1823832e8f530\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;No, not that kind of pug, this...</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27292172\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/292/172/8c43ab05d6e9da7ec37a3b7158418d8a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574331758&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f3aafb99b90e80815ee43ecaac63b04a\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This machine takes the clay (even bone dry clay) and extrudes it out in a form that is ready to be rolled and slumped!
