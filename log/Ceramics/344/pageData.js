Materials constantly get used up and must be replaced.  Electricity to run an electric kiln costs.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that clay bodies may all have variations from batch to batch, results may be somewhat unpredictable, especially when firing in a gas kiln, raku kiln, or wood fire kiln (types of kilns I use at every opportunity).  Pieces may not be as dry as one thinks when loading a kiln, they occasionally crack during firing.\r\n\r\nKnowing the inherent unpredictability of working with clay, I routinely make more shapes than I think I need, in order to guarantee that the correct number of successful forms leave the kiln.\r\n\r\nI also maintain a day job, to ensure that even during dry spells of pottery, I have sufficient funds to keep my studio running.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":3,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>1 coffee mug</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-05-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">May 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>2 coffee mugs</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-05-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">May 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Set of 4 dinner plates</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-05-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">May 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>"],"number_of_FAQ":"0","number_of_updates":"0","number_of_comments_depth_all":"0","contents_of_FAQ":[],"last_updated":"February 17, 2016"}
