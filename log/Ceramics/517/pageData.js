I am an educator by day and an artist by night. I came to love throwing clay on the wheel during my early college years. I was able to get a minor in Studio Art with the concentration in ceramics. Along with the art experience, I have several degrees in education and photography. For the past 20 years I have focused on growing a family, putting 2 kids through college and working full time, many times with 2 jobs. Now the time has come for me to start a small part-time business where I can share my abilities at thowing clay and making functional wares. As with all my projects, I look forward to the adventure and the journey.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Robert Martindale","creator_last_login":1437609707,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":0,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/914/384/8be17a397430f6885085939f782b9567_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461649893&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=62651c9325a015374b876455f00eb08d","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/717202238","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>My Business\nPlan:</p><p>Goal: To\nraise enough funding to help purchase a kiln and other necessary items to start\na small business, making functional ceramic wares (pots, bowls, mugs, plates,\nurns, house wares).</p><p>Phase 1: $3000.00</p><p>I would like\nto&nbsp;raise $3000.00 to purchase a kiln. This money would buy a new kiln,\ninstallation of electrical or gas outlets, pay Kickstarter fees, and help with\nshipping of rewards. </p><p>1.Purchase kiln in July</p><p>2.Pay Kickstarter fees at close of\nproject</p><p>3.Have kiln installed</p><p>4.Purchase glaze material</p><p>5.Create rewards for shipping in the\ncoming months.</p><p>Phase 2: $4800.00</p><p>1.If I can raise $4800.00 I would like\nto purchase a new potter’s wheel. Although the current potter’s wheel is handy, a faster wheel would help\nto improve the quality of my work. </p><p>2.Purchase clay and glaze material.</p><p>Phase 3: $8800.00</p><p>1.If I can raise $8800.00 I would like\nto add onto my shed and create a small studio work area. Here I would be able to\ncreate a work space and be able to display my handmade&nbsp;items for my business.\nThe money would be used to purchase building materials to build/add a room to\nthe current structure in place. </p><p>Thank You for your help and support. It truly means\nmore than you will ever know. Check me out on Instragram&nbsp; @palmtreepots&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp; can also so watch me make pots on Youttube during the 30 days&nbsp; of this Kickstarter.

This will be a small business and all items are handmade. Problems can arise where items need to be created again due to kiln damage, or problems with firing. Backers need to understand that ceramics take time to produce. Once created, there is drying time, and 2 seperate firing times.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":11,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>You will receive a Thank You card and a link to watch the first kiln opening.</p>\n\n<p>There is a free shipping with in US and $2.00 rest of the world added to the pledge at checkout.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-09-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sep 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>You will receive a Thank You card and the link to watch the first kiln opening.</p>\n\n<p>There is a free shipping with in US and $2.00 rest of the world added to the pledge at checkout.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-09-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sep 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>You will receive a Thank You card and a video link to watch the first kiln opening.
