In this picture, you see our fuel (wood), the door of the kiln, the stoke hole, and the primary air holes.

It takes a good hard-working team to get it all completed.</p>\n<br>\n<p>The glowing embers you see at the bottom of the picture have fallen from the burning logs that are sitting on a grate behind the largest brick in the photo. Air travels into the kiln through those holes, aiding in fuel combustion and ash production. I think the kiln was at about 1900F in this photo.
