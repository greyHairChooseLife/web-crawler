My lovely little kiln has supported me through a long journey of making. It recently came to the end of its life.

I couldn't ask for you kind people to raise funds for the entire thing, so I am asking for <span class=\"bold\">help towards 50% of the costs of the kiln plus £100 towards getting an electrical supply installed. </span>For contributions of £10 or more, you will have the opportunity to <span class=\"bold\">own a piece of my work, learn more about clay </span>or<span class=\"bold\"> give your children a clay party!</span></p>\n<p>The development of my own practice as a ceramicist has fed directly into my career as an <span class=\"bold\">artist educator</span>. Through exciting developments and big mistakes, I have learned a lot about clay, and <span class=\"bold\">nothing gives me more pleasure than to share this knowledge with others</span>. Over the last 10 years, <span class=\"bold\">I have taught over 2500 people how to use clay</span> - from school children who have never touched the stuff before, through to adults making their artistic practice a central part of their lives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My mission to share my work and knowledge with others <span class=\"bold\">will become impossible</span> without access to this essential piece of equipment.&nbsp;No kiln, no ceramics!</p>\n<p>For more information on my work as an artist educator or to see projects that I have been involved in, please visit my website by clicking <a href=\"http://www.lydiahardwick.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.lydiahardwick.co.uk/new-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Family Day clay workshop at the Whitechapel Gallery\" data-caption=\"Family Day clay workshop at the Whitechapel Gallery\" data-id=\"24728032\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Family Day clay workshop at the Whitechapel Gallery\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/728/032/22a033bc46e665bd0ec6e6e0d94a9caa_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1554928399&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=98182822c342e42b5c5ee375e210d1ab\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Family Day clay workshop at the Whitechapel Gallery</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</a>\n\n<h1 id=\"h:what-can-you-get-in\" class=\"page-anchor\">WHAT CAN YOU GET IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR HELP?</h1>\n<h1 id=\"h:a-collaged-clay-deco\" class=\"page-anchor\">A Collaged Clay Decoration&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Collaged Clay Decorations... take a lucky dip!\" data-caption=\"Collaged Clay Decorations... take a lucky dip!\" data-id=\"24733369\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Collaged Clay Decorations... take a lucky dip!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/733/369/556931cf7f7761265b74a6059674d4a5_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1554969885&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b0e1ffa352b4c3535492581066a7a6c5\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Collaged Clay Decorations... take a lucky dip!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I stain clay different colours using oxides, and then inlay the colours into the surface of another sheet of clay.

To make the pattern, I stain clay different colours using oxides, and then inlay the colours into the surface of another sheet of clay. I then cut out the shape of the plate, and form the edges. The plate is carefully dried and bisque fired to 1000 degrees celsius. You can also choose whether you would like this to be glazed (for use with all foodstuffs), or unglazed (for decorative or non-oily foodstuffs use). Either way, the plate is then fired for a second time up to 1230 degrees.
