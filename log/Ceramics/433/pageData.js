Over the past 5 years I have attended ceramic residencies in France, China, Japan, South Korea and India. I have exhibited my work on each of these occasions. My work received an honourable mention at the 2013 Cheonju Biennale in South Korea and I was also short listed for 2013 Manningham Victorian Ceramic Art Award and the 2014 Gold Coast International Ceramic Art Award. I have exhibited widely through group and solo exhibitions and my work is represented in the Li Zi Yuan Museum and Qingdao museum in China, the International Artists Collection at the Seto Cultural Centre in Japan and the Wanju Macsabel International Collection in South Korea. \r\nI use porcelain and stoneware to create sculptural forms. I am fascinated by texture, pattern and flamboyant form. I am interested in human nature and my work reflects the idea that we can manipulate the way we are perceived by the way we present ourselves, and that this may not be a true reflection of who we really are. So in short I look at ‘self’ and ‘identity’. I am inspired by the textural patterns and forms of sea life and microscopic images.  I grew up on the coast in Australia and my work has often been described as having a ‘sea life’ feel to it. I am passionate about my art and my medium and I strive for innovation.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Sally Walk","creator_last_login":1479527366,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://sallywalk.com","domain":"sallywalk.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/364/697/dcd4c6c513d06437c541c2b68aa7a6d8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461585910&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=dfcc1eb77acef9e50f1254d7005c9844","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1648008237","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div>&nbsp;<p><i>I have been accepted to exhibit my sculptures at the\nFlorence Biennale in October 2015. This is a huge opportunity for me as a\nceramic artist from Australia and I am going to create some really ambitious\n and quite large sculptures using fine white porcelain/stoneware clay. I have a BA- Ceramic Design and am a practising ceramic artist. In\nthe past 4 years I have attended symposiums and exhibited my work in France,\nChina, Japan, South Korea and India. I am asking for help to fund this project as it offers a real opportunity to\nfurther my artistic career. I'm really excited about&nbsp;exposing my artwork to a larger global market.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I am seeking&nbsp;funding to freight 4 large ceramic\nsculptures to Italy. In addition I will also need to get myself to Italy for\nthe duration of the Biennale and cover the costs involved in exhibiting at the\nBiennale. Some of the major costs for this project include the </i><i>Biennale exhibition costs ($3800), Flights and accommodation&nbsp;in Italy ($3000), freight to send 4 large sculptures ($4000) and of course there is still the costs involved with creating the artwork itself.&nbsp;In return for your support I will create a range of limited edition\nporcelain pendants, tea cups&nbsp;and a number of small sculptures. I'll also keep you in the loop by writing a blog&nbsp;on the progress of the sculptures, their transit and final presentation&nbsp;in Italy.</i></p><p><i>This is a real opportunity for the advancement of my artistic career.&nbsp;I hope that you can help me to make\nthis happen and I thank you in advance for your support.</i></p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Potential risks for this project include damage to the artwork during transit and so I will create extra work should that happen.
