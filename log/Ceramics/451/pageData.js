If that is the case, we'll paint it using effect glazing which should slide into the small valleys due to surface tension and thereby make the engravings darker and highlight the fine details. We plan to go with the traditional 9306 Sapphire Blue glazing from BOTZ so that our mugs will feel right at home next to more traditional fine dining plates.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h:why-kickstarter\" class=\"page-anchor\">Why Kickstarter?</h1>\n<p>Because we cannot afford it otherwise. The next steps towards actually producing usable ceramic mugs are to purchase a casting machine for €24,000 and a kiln for €10,000. We will also need to hire or contract a casting expert to make sure we won't have air bubbles.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h:financials\" class=\"page-anchor\">Financials</h1>\n<p>Since we will most likely not hit a high enough mug count to be able to use an automated machine, our current plan is to produce these mugs as hand-made in northern Germany. But that may change if we can use a robot instead. But based on the hand-made idea, we estimate the following costs per mug:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Ceramic material and casting supplies: €10</li>\n  <li>Glazing: €3</li>\n  <li>Working time: casting, glazing, firing €5 each</li>\n  <li>Kiln supplies and electricity: €7</li>\n</ul>\n<p>=&gt; In total, we expect roughly €34 in net production costs per mug.</p>\n<p>Out of the €59 per mug that we ask for, we will need to pay 19% taxes and 5% Kickstarter fees, meaning we can use €47 to pay for the €34 in per-item resource costs and we can allocate a per-mug share of €13 for the production equipment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The necessary production equipment costs €34,000 which means that we'll need to produce roughly 2615 mugs to break even.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>=&gt; We need a total of €155,000 in Kickstarter backing excluding shipping fees, or roughly €207,000 including shipping fees.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">This project carries the risk that we purchase the necessary machinery, but are still unable to make the actual ceramic production work at the necessary quality level. That risk cannot be fully avoided as the whole point of this project is to produce ceramics that are so delicate that it would be impossible to produce them with conventional methods.\n\nTo mitigate the risk, we will produce the first ceramic prototypes and then send around photos and a poll to all backers. Then, the backers can decide if:\na) The prototypes look good and we should go ahead with the batch production\nb) We produce the mugs out of dishwasher-safe food-safe plastic instead of ceramics, which will surely work\na) We initiate a refund of the remaining money to all backers and send no physical products. You'll still be able to make your own attempts using the 3D printing files, but it'll be a lot less fancy.\n\nThere is also the risk that we cannot hire a casting professional on time after the prototypes have turned out OK. In that case, all rewards will be delayed by a few months, which would be rather sad because then you won't be able to hand these mugs out at Christmas.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">€15</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 15</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nDIY 3D-printing files\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>We'll send you the digital design files that we use to 3D-print prototypes, molds, and inverse-molds for casting.</p>\n<span class=\"itemization-includes text-uppercase c-navy-light type-10 medium ls1px block\">Includes:</span>\n<ul class=\"type-14 ml3 green-dark mb2 pl2\">\n<li class=\"list-disc\">\nDIY 3D-printing files\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2020-04-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Apr 2020</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">€59</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 58</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\n1 Impossible Mug: Dolphin\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Receive one professionally produced Impossible Mug made out of ceramic and with food-safe dishwasher-safe glaze in dark blue.
