These plates have no such ambition. These are kitschy representations of such lowbrow subject matter as hot dogs, hairless cats, B movies, and serial killers. By purchasing these plates and displaying them prominently in your house you will undoubtedly be blacklisted in academic circles. Decorators will turn up their noses at your choice of dishware. And yes it's more than likely that your own parents and your parents parents will remove you from their will and will no longer keep in contact. That strange guy you used to cavort with in college will suddenly reappear and wish to spend long weekends crashing at your house, naked, drinking up your scotch, and criticizing you for your musical and literary choices. Yes that guy may be me. And if this doesn't convince you to buy one of these amazing plates I don't know what will. So go on, you know you want to. </p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">If we can't raise enough money to fulfill the minimum order all monies will be returned, and Leigh will cry into his whisky for three days.
