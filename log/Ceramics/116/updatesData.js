These are pledges that only had mugs in them, no add ons. The rest of the add ons should be hear in early August. We were hoping to be completely done by no later than July but the disruptions caused by the pandemic to the supply chain have only gotten worse since we launched this in April. A lot of our suppliers are out of base materials to work with so it's taken longer than we wanted to to get everything situated.</p>\n<br>\n<p> Now, the bad news: one item is proving troublesome beyond belief. The shot glass we wanted for this project is out of stock, and it won't be back until mid September. We debated asking if a different shape/model would be to your liking but, in the end, we decided that it would be best to deliver the item that was promised, even if it meant being late.</p>\n<br>\n<p> One more piece of good news: rather than have you wait on the shot glass, we're going to take it on the chin and absorb the cost of two shipments. Once the other add ons arrive, we will finish shipping all pledges, and then send out the shot glass by itself once it is complete (current ETA is sometime in October).</p>\n<br>\n<p>We are sorry for these delays and appreciate your patience and understanding as we learn to navigate this brave new world. </p>\n<br>\n<p>John C.</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1624989597,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMyMzMwNDY=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"What are we waiting on?","publishedAt":1624989597,"pinnedAt":null,"number":7,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Biggs Tiki","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/536/103/2f302d4bdf0bad14c14fc8dd4962b9a0_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1592609271&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1a860ab1c39829b11bfae59885977572","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1623692093,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMyMTg4MTM=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Locking orders","publishedAt":1623692093,"pinnedAt":null,"number":6,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Biggs Tiki","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/536/103/2f302d4bdf0bad14c14fc8dd4962b9a0_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1592609271&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1a860ab1c39829b11bfae59885977572","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Greetings marvelous Tiki fans!</p>\n<br>\n<p>We have sent out the final reminder today that orders are now set to lock so we can gather data for the add on manufacturing: you now have 48 hours to complete and/or make changes to your pledges (such as adding items and confirming your shipping address).

If you decide on local pickup, we will refund you your shipping fees after you pick up your pledge from our friends at the Little Shop of Magic, here in Las Vegas, NV.</p>\n<br>\n<p> If you decide to splurge a little and add additional mugs, coasters, shirts, etc. to your pledge, please remember that some of these items are limited in nature: once we run out we run out, and you may see limits in place for a maximum number or items (we wanted to make sure more backers had a shot at getting at least one for themselves).
