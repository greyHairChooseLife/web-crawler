My new pottery wheel arrived much earlier than anticipated, and I drove to pick it up from Spartanburg, SC two weeks ago. It is a beautiful wheel and has been working perfectly.

I hope everyone loves what they receive, and I hope you know the joy that has gone into making them. With the process well underway, I can say that I will be able to start shipping this month, and I anticipate that the last orders will go out no later than November. I’m so excited to be able to start sending your rewards. I will send an update when I start shipping!

I will be getting a replacement from the company, but they are backordered until October.

Once trimmed, they are set to dry until most all of the moisture has left the clay. My first batch of ”greenware”, or clay that has not been fired yet, is going to be going to be kiln fired this week. Once pots have gone through their first firing, they can be glazed, and after that can be fired a second and final time. The whole process takes about 2-3 weeks at the clay studio. I will continue to give you all updates when the first batch is glazed and ready to ship! You will be getting a survey from me soon asking for your shipping info. I’m still on track to ship everyone’s rewards by December!</p>\n<br>\n<p>I am having so much fun with this process already, and every moment on the wheel is bringing me immense joy. This project has made me feel so supported and encouraged, and each moment working on your pots is a gift to me.
