I work as a Special Education teacher focusing on students diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and I coach wrestling.

Since I returned to the classroom as a teacher I have had the opportunity to step into the art room, something I haven't done since I earned my undergrad in Fine Arts. As I sat down behind the potters wheel for the first time in a long time I began to feel the creative juices flow again and fell back in love with creating pottery.

I am working to raise funds in order to create my own pottery studio that will focus on functional everyday products that will make unique gifts and collectibles. Currently, I work full time as a special education teacher and specialize in developing social interaction skills for students that have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Ultimately, I would like to utilize the business as an avenue for some of my students to experience the arts and what they have to offer as well as gain valuable,real world, work experience. In addition, I am also a veteran, having served 8 years in the National Guard and a deployment to Afghanistan in 2010-11. Another vision I have is to be able to create opportunities for veterans to become exposed to pottery in a way that they may have never experienced. I want to be able to do this by offering discounts and classes specific to veterans with in the community.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"17043142\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/043/142/d4f014cb63bbbb86860666e20f03d367_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1497103750&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=18df1a16e3ab6d78eafa034418a4a47f\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"17043146\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/043/146/abaeffdec2d826f683148645ffeaa615_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1497103770&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b83846120c748a868a9caf2bc7068358\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">This venture has limited risks and challenges. However, some that may manifest could be items that break during shipping, inaccuracy in orders, or inaccurate charges to orders. One major way that I anticipate dealing with these issues is through the formation of an Etsy Store. for a small fee that is incorporated into the cost of the product, Etsy acts as the third party for transactions and shipping. Once I establish my business and am in need of employees I anticipate hiring advanced high school art students that can work on an as needed bases for a small stipend. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the things that I have already established in developing my business plan. I created a name for my ceramics company, Ryne Tucker Ceramics, which is a combination of names between my two sons. I recently developed an Etsy page to start marketing my products and I am in talks with a web designer to create a visually appealing webpage that can display my products, my overall message, and my vision for the future in an appealing format. I am also planning on marketing and pushing my brand recognition through Facebook and Instagram as well as various hats and t-shirts designed to aid in raising capital. Once I have established my business, I will create a YouTube page that documents the progress that my business makes as well as create a collection of instructional videos that anyone can watch. \r\n\r\nBecause I am a teacher I have an added benefit to the creation of my business, I have a full-time job with summers off, This allows me the time devotion needed for this venture without sacrificing my own living expenses to do so. As a result, I am able to focus on the necessities of building my business and not have to create and sell expensive, time consuming works of art that take months to produce in order to raise capital and pay for living expenses. Focusing on products such as cups, bowls, and plates of various sizes and glazes allows me to quickly produce pieces that I can sell and ship to customers in a reasonably short period of time and at a reasonable price. \r\n\r\nInitially, this Kickstarter money will fund the products I need to establish the essentials of my business. I will purchase a professional potter's wheel, a kiln largest enough to fire 20-25 pieces, a small assortment of glazes and hand tools, and of course clay. I am also fortunate that one of the largest pottery supply companies is located in my city. This allows me to cut out any wait time and shipping expenses in getting the parts and products that I need. \r\n\r\nThe use of the Kickstarter money is just that, a kick start into become a small business entrepreneur. Once I receive the money needed to start my business I will continue to build capital through some of the methods I have discussed and reinvest them into my business, ultimately creating a Veteran Owned business that not only generates visually stunning pieces of art, but services individuals within the community that can gain huge benefits from the arts as well.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nIce Cream Bowl\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Each donation of $100 will receive a 6\" ice cream bowl.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-10-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Oct 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 200</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 200</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nDinner Plates\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Each donation of $200 will receive a set of 2 matching 12\" dinner plates.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-11-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Nov 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 500</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 500</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\n3 Bowls\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Three matching bowls of various sizes.
