I consider myself very lucky being able to do something I love every day! </p><p>Over the years I've produced many pieces with different themes such as Toothless, Disney characters and rainbow designs, as well as offering commissions. My most recent project is the My Little Pony Cutie Mark Line which I launched around a year ago and has been more successful than any other project I've undertaken. It's been a very slow process building up the business as equipment in this field is pretty expensive. The most expensive being a kiln, which is needed to fire each ceramic piece I paint to lock in the painted colours and make them all waterproof, food safe etc.</p><p>Until now I have been borrowing a kiln and (I'm pleased to say) I've outgrown the arrangement and now the time has come for me to purchase my own kiln! I plan on using any funds raised with this campaign to purchase a large industrial kiln that retails for roughly £4000. I already have some of the funds saved so now I just need the rest within the next few months to prevent my little venture from grinding to a halt D:</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">As I've been in the ceramic field for so long, I have a strong relationship with all of my suppliers, including the firm I am planning on purchasing a kiln from. There are no potential obstacles that would crop up after the campaign is over as everything is in place to purchase and install the kiln safely.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">£10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 12</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nMLP Hanging Cutie Mark Heart\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A cute hanging heart decoration painted in the pony's colouring with a cutie mark on both sides. \n<br>Choose from one of the Mane Six :D</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-12-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Dec 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">£20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 23</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nMLP Cutie Mark Mug\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A cute mug painted inside &amp; out with cutie marks on both sides.
