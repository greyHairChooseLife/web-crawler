I have been drawing for as long as I can remember and it is something that I have always gained so much joy from. After studying Computer Games Art for 3 years and graduating, I decided I wanted to share my artwork with the rest of the world, and hopefully create designs that other people love, too! All products are 100% designed by me.</p><p>I'm using Kickstarter to help bring my designs to life and really appreciate anyone who takes the time to have a look and support me :) I want to make the world more colourful :D</p><p>If we reach over the goal, the extra funding will be put towards other products and designs. I'd really love to see this happen :D</p><p>Thank you for looking and I hope you enjoy what I have to offer! &lt;3</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The estimated delivery date is October.
