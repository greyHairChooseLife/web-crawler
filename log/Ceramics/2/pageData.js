My name is Gregory Delgadillo and I want to continue being a potter !</p>\n<br>\n<p>I created this Kickstarter so I can start creating pottery again. With your help I will have the funds to purchase a new kiln ! If you havn't already pledged and want to know a little bit about the project and who I am please take the time to read how I’ve come to this point in my life .&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<p>I was born in Salinas , Ca. in 1992 and lived a pretty normal life up until 6th grade . My life was turned upside down and I gravitated to what was around me to get away from my home problems. Unfortunately, I was suffocated with more drugs and gangs. I fell into the trap that a lot of young men are victims to in the 831 area and went on to sell cannabis which lead to purchasing a gun at the age of 13. Needless to say life was hitting me with some big punches but luckily for me I was adopted by my moms sister and was taken away to Gonzales, Ca. Where I spent my high school years.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"38155147\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/038/155/147/6eafcfc3033d072fcbd8c9a5ff820973_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1659470941&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=131254a99bf6a808747e41271136382d\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Gonzales was like another world and far from the life style I was living in Salinas but I was still very angry and sad from the series of unfortunate events that had been transpiring. I turned to graffiti, back yard boxing, car racing and was still selling weed. Through all the bad moments and even worse habits I had developed, two underly traits managed to rise to the top. I loved being creative and art had me wrapped around its little finger, I couldn't get enough. The other was entrepreneurship , selling things of any kind made me feel like I had just won the lottery. I went as far as silk screening my own shirts and selling them at the GHS car show. I had great results but unfortunat instead of a pat on the back for initiative, I was labeled a bootlegger.&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<p>I felt like my knack for business and love for creativity was never watered and died until years later where I became a cook. I lived and breathed the culinary arts and took it as far as I could for 8 years; working multiple jobs to maximize my time learning different aspects of the industry, Interning for free for months at some of the worlds greatest restaurants, and constantly searching for more.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"38155228\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/038/155/228/2e824da1445a783d5e419a5763976388_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1659471382&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e4e2b7e6d6a433893a7bb04a00dc3a45\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I put so much energy into the craft and then the pandemic hit . I had all this creative energy and no where to put it until I found pottery. I stumbled upon Peninsula a Potters in Pacific Grove, Ca. A very quaint studio with a gang of elderly ladies ready to let you know what time it is... jk, they were all super sweet. With the same burning heart and laser focus, I attacked the art form of pottery and spent day and night honing my skills for two years. While the world was on pause I stared at a spinning wheel with a lump of clay on it and thought to myself \"This is fucking rad!\". &nbsp;Pottery was like something I learned in a past life , it just came to me and I embraced it wholeheartedly .&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"38155014\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/038/155/014/65776c63fa256f0bb0264fadffe4b9e9_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1659470148&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f336aad62bd34aa7470dea05d5d7e80c\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Once the pandemic protocols lifted and life went back to the some what normal reality we live in today, I look back at my time at the pottery studio and it reminds me of the balance it brought me and how I want that back!</p>\n<br>\n<p>So I'm asking you all to help me fund this Kickstarter so I can purchase a Kiln and all the other odds and ends that go into creating pottery !
