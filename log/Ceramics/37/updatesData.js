We wish you a very happy holiday season and welcome you to go to our <a href=\"http://rplusrceramics.com\" target=\"_blank\">rplusrceramics.com</a> website and sign up for our email updates. This is the best way to follow our progress, see our new work and next steps in the new year. We'd really love to keep in touch this way!</p><p>Very Best,</p><p>Ruth + Rob</p><p>If you're interested in a bit of an inside look at what we've learned from this Kickstarter, the 2 shows we attended, and just being involved in producing and selling this work this year, keep reading. We learned so much and here are a few highlights:</p><p>- Never underestimate the psychology of price! We seem to have struck a strange in- between price point that was not quite high nor low enough. Although our sales have been decent, people would fall in love with the work over and over but express that the pieces were too special and too high priced for everyday. After much thinking and a few trial experiences to see what happened with higher and lower prices and different customers, we're shifting towards making pieces that are specialty items that are perfect gifts or focal points. It still may be a bowl or a cup but we'll put a little more work into each one and will be able to charge a little more. We can't make money at a lower price point and as it turns out, more specialty pieces are where our interests lie anyway so this is a good thing. Want to see what we're making next spring? Sign up for email updates www.rplusrceramics.com</p><p>- Shipping takes MUCH longer than we expected, oy vey! It's so much work for such a low price. This will also be remedied by the higher price point. Fewer items, better profit.</p><p>- The outpouring of support we experienced with this Kickstarter as well as with our wholesalers, customers, fans has been wonderful and the effect of receiving this level of support is like having a superpower. It has changed our outlook on life to say the least!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4965949\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/965/949/d186f6cf19f4bba2e6c3b96a024a695a_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1448303227&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=3f55c8464d838780e3b278fa23ad20ad\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1446606261,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE0MDM2NDg=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Your pieces are coming soon!","publishedAt":1446606260,"pinnedAt":null,"number":9,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Ruth Frances Greenberg + Robert Streff","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/941/210/aceb305714ae263e95427dbec64b8576_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461654674&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=666f14f7d181b8a3511b8544d17bea25","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Dear Friend, </p><p>If you are still waiting for your gift(s), please know that they are coming soon.

We reached our goal and we're feeling big, wide, tall, vast gratitude to you, our awesome friends.</p><p>If you'd like to keep on going, we do have a few stretch goals that could give us a professional edge.</p><p>STRETCH GOALS:</p><p>#1Taking us to $7,500. would buy us some much needed graphic art and professional photography (stills).</p><p>#2 Taking us to $9,000. would enable us to develop our much desired bowl plates in lunch and dinner sizes this summer. Bowl Plate = you don't quite want a bowl, you don't quite want a flat plate, you want a bowl plate! We've found that the majority of our meals work best in the uniquely useful and satisfying vessel.</p><p>Again, thank you for your fantastic support and high fives all around!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"spoon rests in the forest at Cape Horn\" data-caption=\"spoon rests in the forest at Cape Horn\" data-id=\"3908958\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"spoon rests in the forest at Cape Horn\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/908/958/949083b72950b9cebeba270a1fa52789_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1433267054&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=59efa0c0e011ff51d531831b8e965588\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">spoon rests in the forest at Cape Horn</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1433174594,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEyNDk2ODE=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Can you take us to the top?","publishedAt":1433174594,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Ruth Frances Greenberg + Robert Streff","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/941/210/aceb305714ae263e95427dbec64b8576_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461654674&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=666f14f7d181b8a3511b8544d17bea25","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>We're in awe of all of you and your generosity to take us this far within just a few days, THANK YOU!</p><p>We are SO CLOSE and just need that little nudge to tip over the top! </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"R+R Espresso cup, Indian Beach\" data-caption=\"R+R Espresso cup, Indian Beach\" data-id=\"3900521\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"R+R Espresso cup, Indian Beach\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/900/521/e00178403c6dcf6f643e1928927a15c8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1433174570&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2a66a2da0111e178c598f347e46fe384\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">R+R Espresso cup, Indian Beach</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1432939138,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEyNDc0NTk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Great first day!","publishedAt":1432939138,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Ruth Frances Greenberg + Robert Streff","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/941/210/aceb305714ae263e95427dbec64b8576_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461654674&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=666f14f7d181b8a3511b8544d17bea25","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":3,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Thanks to you and you and you, we've had a great first day! Big appreciation from us to you for contributing so generously and for sharing, sharing and continuing to share this with your people. xoxoxo</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A few piece of R+R Ceramics, Ecola State Park\" data-caption=\"A few piece of R+R Ceramics, Ecola State Park\" data-id=\"3886463\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A few piece of R+R Ceramics, Ecola State Park\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/886/463/34d826ec4147cc082c240604d0f7aa96_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1432938894&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4350a03e277b5461e2315ee47207e13c\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A few piece of R+R Ceramics, Ecola State Park</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1432842661,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"5000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"8263.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":70,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
