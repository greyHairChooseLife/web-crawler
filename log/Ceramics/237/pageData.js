They are unique and full of personality that you just don't see in mass produced ceramics. My belief is that due to the uniqueness of handmade ceramics, their texture, their look... all of these factors encourages the owners to hold onto them for a long long time! To give them that feeling that, \"this product is mine, and not one other person has one exactly like it.\" </p><p>So this project is to get more handmade ceramics out into YOUR hands! A little piece of usable art that will last a longggg time (not counting accidents, like your cat Sally pushing it off the kitchen table!)</p><p>The money raised here will cover studio time, clay, glaze, firing fees and shipping.</p><p>From my hand to yours! Thanks for looking.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\"></p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xNjQ3NTAwODQ1","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":2,"number_of_comments_depth_all":0,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nTo make a limited run of handmade ceramic tumblers/cups and bowls.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/312/247/a09239a6d9b2bedc73fe2fe70e7f7699_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463680820&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=43a67b93319ab179a42a335c5871644d","last_updated":"February 2, 2012","project_name":"andmade Ceramics","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"575","amount_of_pledged":"776","number_of_backers":"24","rate_of_funded":134,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Boston, MA","creator_name":"Mamif","creator_location":"Jamaica Plain, Boston, MA","creator_description":"Currently Continuing Creating Creations","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1408301581,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://thosewhomake.com","domain":"thosewhomake.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/308/831/a09239a6d9b2bedc73fe2fe70e7f7699_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461380000&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=881aa7de83a7211f6d9e1e1c530cff1c","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/mamif","top_cities_location_1st":"Chicago United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"2","top_cities_location_2st":"Ottawa Canada","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_cities_location_3st":"Monterrey Mexico","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_cities_location_4st":"Canberra Australia","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_cities_location_5st":"Arlington United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_cities_location_6st":"Chelsea United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Cincinnati United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Dublin United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Fresno United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Fullerton United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"19","top_countries_location_2st":"Australia","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_countries_location_3st":"Canada","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_countries_location_4st":"Mexico","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","number_of_new_backers":5,"number_of_returning_backers":19}
