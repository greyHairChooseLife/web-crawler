Now I am preparing to take the next step in my endeavor. With your help, I will be attending Penland School of Craft in North Carolina for an eight-week ceramics workshop with Cynthia Bringle. This workshop will help me improve my craft as a potter and introduce me to many new concepts for future projects. My goal for this Kickstarter campaign is to raise $2000 in order improve my skills as a potter by creating a new line of pottery. I will be working on a glaze that compliments this surface design this fall. Your financial contribution toward this effort will be rewarded with my current line of functional ceramics and will be used to help me attend Penland's spring workshop.</p><p>    My History in Ceramics</p><p>    I started working in clay four years ago during an \"Artist in the School Program\" with a local potter, Paul Dungan. The program took place at Homer Flex High School where I taught wood working, math, and science for 16 years. During this program I found that I really enjoyed working with clay. I realized that more students were interested in creating pieces in clay as well. Using money from the school's rustic furniture business we created a pottery studio and began learning about ceramics. In order to teach students I took a hand building ceramics course and taught my self how to throw over a couple of years. Last winter I finally took a wheel throwing course at our local college. This year I retired from teaching and I am pursuing my passion of creating a small business selling functional pottery. Now I am looking to take the next step in my work.</p><p>    The Workshop</p><p>    This workshop will explore mostly wheel-thrown pottery—from technique to design—with an eye toward raising each student’s skills to the next level. I will be working with stoneware and porcelain and firing in a gas and soda kilns. The workshop will include field trips to area studios and discussions of studio practice and marketing. During a two-week visit, Jerolyn Morrison will introduce the ancient pot-making and cooking techniques of the Minoan civilization (3000–1485 BCE). I will be making and using Minoan-style cooking pots to create ancient flavors. My intent in taking the course at Penland is to improve my technique and establish a brand that gives my work individuality that blends my passions for ceramics with my science and math backgrounds. </p><p>    The Bottom Line</p><p>    This Kickstarter project will help me pay for tuition and allow me to get my ceramic pieces in the hands of those who support my work. Currently, I have been working this summer and saved $2000 for the programs $4176. The Kickstarter is for $2000 to cover the remainder. </p><p>    My Project</p><p>    This year I retired from 20 years of teaching and I am pursuing my passion of creating functional and ornamental ceramics.

The combination of my science background and passion for craft inspires me to look at the natural forms, colors, and features and incorporate them into my art.
