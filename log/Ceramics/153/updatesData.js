I picked up the second round of glaze samples today! With the exception of some minor tweaks, I think they're about where I envisioned them. The white glaze did something really weird on the lemon tart, the final won't look crinkly like that. Same with the pink on the macaron. And the heart cake will have a pink frosting closer to the macaron. These were tests of different mixes, so with the next round I should be able to get things smoothed out.</p>\n<p>Also, just a general timeline update. I think it's safer to say these are probably going to be shipping out in April. Because of supply chain issues, I wasn't able to get more slip until just last week and now I'm finding that the white glaze, the one that doesn't crinkle, is out of stock most places. I still have some of that glaze, but that's the one that makes up most of the pink so I can see running out pretty quickly.  As well as that, some of the figures, the chests specifically and the berries on the heart cakes, take more time to put together than anticipated, but I want to take my time to make them look good and make sure the pieces don't come apart. </p>\n<p>But, in any case, we're really into production now so I'll update if anything major happens and for sure post another update once they're all ready to go to their new homes! </p>\n<p>Thanks again for supporting us!</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1644373711,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTM0MjYwNjE=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Glaze Colors","publishedAt":1644373711,"pinnedAt":null,"number":12,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"mitsuhanii","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/034/697/685/5cc5f1e1cc3732a737cafcd385bb468d_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1630387505&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=a1d7dabca1c9be94e24ea921a6bb56d5","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":1,"body":"<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"the glaze base colors\" data-id=\"36307255\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/307/255/b5f1e30e69a30eb8a108a453a2fadcc4_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1644372946&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e705456aa549a9c2240095f30340e9e6\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">the glaze base colors</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"mimic chest glaze\" data-id=\"36307284\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/307/284/178663b459f1e2bfba2df565fe8fabab_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1644373250&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=3d6b10e7005b5c7675ed965b14c6a48d\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">mimic chest glaze</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>In the next few weeks, we're finally going to be getting to the firing stage.

I'm not as familiar with using plaster for creating slip cast molds so I had to try different release methods since the ones I usually use (vaseline, pam spray, oil based things) can be absorbed into the plaster and block it from absorbing water which is needed for slip casting.

It can be pretty laborious (almost sprained my thumb 😅) and time consuming, mostly creating the clay boundaries part and clean up to do it all over again. Creating the boundaries is easier with water-based clay (it doesn't get stiff the same way oil clay does) but I don't have any so I've been using what I have - oil clay, which is the same as what the models are made of. Now that I'm getting a rhythm for it and narrowed down the process it'll be easier to make the casts and send em off!</p>\n<br>\n<p>This one's a little lopsided but successful nonetheless.😆 After it's done I clean out any left over clay and let it dry for 24 hrs~, that way I know it's fully cured.</p>\n<br>\n<p>-Helena/Nena Mágica✨</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"First successful plaster cast!
