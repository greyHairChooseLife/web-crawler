Some have bigger defects than others, but where there is a crack, it is usually (but not always) at the back. (Look at the two orange pixies in the photo - you can see the crack, one on the back -(girl on left hand side) and a smaller crack on the front of the boy on the right, just to the right of his right hand). None of these misfit pixies have really big cracks on their front. &nbsp;Some have other issues... I may not have been happy with the glaze, or they may have no buttons on their tunic, or something. The good news (yes, there's more!) is that if I found the problem before I glazed that particular little chap, I could then glaze in random colours, not trying to match the colours dictated by the Well Known US TV [... you know who], so there are plenty of different colours and unique variations in this bunch.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">If you pledge</span> for a Misfits reward, you will get two random misfits (I will try to make them complimentary, and will pair the armless ones together). Please note that I had a lot more boys made before I pulled out of the deal, there are a lot more boy misfits, and as such, your pair may be two boys. There are also a VERY SMALL amount of fairy misfits, so your pair could be a pixie/fairy pair either.</p><h1 id=\"h:and-theres-more\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">AND THERE'S MORE!</span></h1><h1 id=\"h:looking-for-jed\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">Looking for Jed:</span></h1><p>At the start, I mentioned a <span class=\"bold\">Treasure Hunt</span>.

If you order more than one pair, the post will reduce per pair (2 pairs will cost €8.00, and so on.) Overseas, the additional shipping charges are small, as they just need to cover the extra bit. Retailer rewards incur relatively small shipping within Ireland but more for overseas, and you may incur customs charges depending on where in the world you live. If you've any questions, please do ask.</i></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Bespoke gift box with foam insert (left) and outer mailing box (right)\" data-caption=\"Bespoke gift box with foam insert (left) and outer mailing box (right)\" data-id=\"16429815\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Bespoke gift box with foam insert (left) and outer mailing box (right)\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/429/815/f740691d365bf9d80db42d15c8e123ec_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1493315824&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8d0993618dde0be52a287175b57e9a32\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Bespoke gift box with foam insert (left) and outer mailing box (right)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Packaging:</span></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Each Pixie Pair comes in a bespoke gift box, with foam padding all around them, as dictated by the shopping channel's very strict packaging standards. Each of these boxes is then packed inside a second box, with foam supports. These boxes have been 'drop tested' within that company's testing labs, and passed the test without breakages.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For the retail level reward, I will not package the branded gift box inside individual mailing boxes but will pack them together in a larger outer carton, to avoid the excess packaging and make for a smaller overall parcel size. For retailers, I can also offer the Pixies in single boxes rather than packed as pairs, but please discuss this with me if interested in this option, as the single boxes are a little different, and also this option may affect postal costs.</p><h1 id=\"h:the-story-get-tissue\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">The Story (get tissues ready)</span></h1><p>&nbsp; I made These Pesky Pixies for a deal I had with a well known US TV Shopping Channel. &nbsp;(In fact, back then they were known more affectionately as Irish Pixies.) They ordered bazillions of them. They knew I handmade them totally, every little step of the way. They saw them, they loved them, and they particularly loved that each is named uniquely and individually. They sent me the purchase order, and I began to eat, sleep, breathe and dream in fluent Pixie. they took over first my studio, then my life.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Except... &nbsp;then the well known US TV Shopping Chanel people decided that although each one is hand cut, hand built, hand painted, and individual - they wanted them to all look <i>totally identical</i>.</p><p>They wanted their little facial expressions to match each other exactly; they wanted the tilt of their heads to be exactly the same, and they wanted them to be exactly the same height, weight, skin tone, blood type, and shoe size. (They don't even have feet.) &nbsp;(I may be exaggerating some points, but you get the gist.) They wanted PIXIE CLONES. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite all this, they still wanted them to have totally individual names. (I even bought a baby names book with 10,000 names in it.)</p><p>I stamped my feet and said 'No way.' &nbsp;</p><p>I said that the point of what I make and how I make it is that everything is handmade and individual. &nbsp; &nbsp;I said 'but each one has it's own little character, they are like people - each one is a little bit different'. &nbsp; &nbsp;I said 'They all have different names, because they are different characters.' &nbsp; &nbsp;I said 'do you guys want handmade or do you want a factory line product?' And they said 'Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, we want handmade, we love it, we really do want lots.... but we still want them all to be EXACTLY the same.' &nbsp;</p><p>So I said 'No way,&nbsp;<i>Really</i>&nbsp;<i>NO WAY</i>'. And I pulled out of the deal. But I had already made a whole bunch of them, and I had bought the packaging, and paid some staff to help keep the pesky little pixies in line on the shelves, and therefore, I am <span class=\"bold\">In Debt</span>. &nbsp;And sulking a bit about it.</p><p>That's where you come in. This has cost me several thousand euro, and I have a whole flock - cluster - gaggle (what's the collective name for Pixies please?) of Pixies on my shelves. So... the obvious solution is to sell the pixies, right? &nbsp;And because I really need to recuperate AT LEAST the cost of the packaging, I want to sell them quick and cheap, so the good news is that I am going to offer them here on Kickstarter at way LESS than that shopping channel was going to offer them for :) &nbsp;Ha!</p><p>The deals here are good ones: the usual retail price for a similar kind of figurine is €32 per figurine. If you're quick, you can get A PAIR of them for way less than that. Can't argue with that, can you?&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">AND THERE'S MORE!</span></p><h1 id=\"h:stretch-goals-there\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">Stretch Goals: &nbsp;There are a couple of stretch goals to be added, both in the form of treasure hunt/random prize kind of things. &nbsp;</span></h1><p><span class=\"bold\">The Hunt for Jed is part of the general campaign, and all backers who pledge for pixies will be in with a chance to find Jed </span><i>(please note, he is a Pixie, so you won't find him in a Fairy Pair)</i></p><p><span class=\"bold\">Stretch Goal 1. €4,000+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>If I reach my<span class=\"bold\"> target </span>of<span class=\"bold\"> €4,000 </span>then<span class=\"bold\"> 'The tale of two <i>Flint</i>s' </span>comes into play:</p><p><span class=\"bold\">As I said, </span>I bought a Baby name book. &nbsp;I worked through it systematically, and crossed off names as I used them.

If this happens, it may impact on the shipping dates.

This won't affect the Early Bird offers, as the number of those rewards are limited.\r\n\r\nIn the event that pledges outnumber the amount of packaging I have already purchased, there may be a slight delay on shipping later pledges while I order more packaging; again, I will update to inform should this happen, and earlier backers will again take priority in the mailing order.\r\n\r\nI'm aiming for a larger goal than previous campaigns, so the more backers who can help share the campaign, the more chance we have of it succeeding.

Again, apologies that this is happening.\n<br>Please note, this ONLY affects backers living in the Republic of Ireland, and only on certain reward levels.
