The program focuses on all aspects of the arts and incorporating those discoveries with the natural world and vis versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Clay is worked with daily. During the warmer months, the electric potters wheel is unwrapped and children are exposed to its processes. As much as we LOVE to support community, it becomes quite challenging to transport the &nbsp;children's work to and from public firings. In order to create more experience with the clay processes, we are in need of an on-site home studio electric kiln.&nbsp;</p><p>The purchase will support the local business we utilize and will give the children at Riverwood House a clearer understanding of how clay transforms with heat! How spectacular! Not only will the children have their work in a timely fashion to share with friends and family, the&nbsp;children will also be able to create pinch pots throughout the year and create a special Riverwood House ornament at the end of the year!
