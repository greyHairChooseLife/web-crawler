Last week artist Salvador Jimenez-Flores joined POW! Founder Hannah Niswonger to celebrate the Mexican Día de Muertos with middle school students in Boston, MA. Each student painted a plate with imagery inspired by Day of the Dead, and made clay food, as offerings to loved ones who have died. The plates and food offerings will be displayed at the middle school, as well as at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, in April 2018.\n\n</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"decorating Día de Muertos — the Day of the Dead plates\" data-caption=\"decorating Día de Muertos — the Day of the Dead plates\" data-id=\"19192268\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"decorating Día de Muertos — the Day of the Dead plates\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/019/192/268/a3359af751886f5fc7bc793777a103d5_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1510530435&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=bc39cffc2d8f33250b9e9f63d45e7654\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">decorating Día de Muertos — the Day of the Dead plates</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>We have found that e-mailings to individual mailing lists are phenomenally effective at increasing donations – fully 90% of our pledges have come as a result of direct email, Facebook and Instagram.
