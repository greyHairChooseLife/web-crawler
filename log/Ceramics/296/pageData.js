Like so many of you out there, you have had that \"ah ha\" moment and you come up with an idea that you think is very unique and novel. Well this is mine. The Stack - A - Mug was created because I was tired of having a cupboard full of mugs that did not stack in my house. As I brained stormed ideas, I came up with this design that allows the mugs to nest (over 50%) and the handles do not touch when stacked! No more chipping, no more clutter, no more inefficient mugs. This is my first design and I look forward to many more to come. However not many times in life can you say you were the <span class=\"bold\">FIRST</span> to try something, well here is your chance. This design is not on the market and the goal of this campaign is to prove there is a demand for it so I can put more funds into R&amp;D to eventually get this to the masses. This is a very difficult space to break into but I know this mug is better than what is sold currently. With your support I can prove it. Thank you!!</p>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Stack - A - Mug\" data-id=\"28545228\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/545/228/6042486c643b7607d82873d3eb9fa205_original.PNG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1585273911&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=ea23a4e0448bda1fb7cec348c291ae8e\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Stack - A - Mug</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Does you cupboard look like this?\" data-id=\"28592734\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/592/734/5a340811465312a8fde220ae1a172c82_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1585702115&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8a9c861bda37ae05e80ef8ea8aa2d7bf\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Does you cupboard look like this?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Three can fit in a standard cabinet\" data-id=\"28592727\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/592/727/b4758662d9e9c1390de431169f8ffc23_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1585702072&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=209430d8e209d34c3d1157ce76177938\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Three can fit in a standard cabinet</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>As you can see the mugs nest nicely on top of one another without the handles interfering with the ability for the cups to stack.
