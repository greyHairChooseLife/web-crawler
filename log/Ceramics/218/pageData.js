It provides a platform for budding talent to show and sell new work. It offers support while giving visitors the opportunity to meet the makers and take inspiration from the next generation of design. This year’s line-up covers every corner of creativity and sees artists responding to some of the most important challenges of our time, from sustainability to social care.</p>\n<p>This is an incredibly exciting opportunity to take my ceramics business to the next level. I completed an MA Craft last year, where I explored the concept of the ‘Biophilia Effect’, which is our intrinsic connection with the natural world. My intention is to address our human need for connection to nature and to bring the spirit of the natural world into manmade spaces through my artwork.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the 'One Year In' show, I am creating a brand new fresh body of work, which illustrates the evolution and growth of my studio practice since graduating. I have been busy in the studio sketching and plotting new ideas. This has guided me to design brand new sequences.</p>\n<p>Why do I need the financial support of a Kickstarter?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I am covering as many of the costs as I can, including that of the stand, but the honest answer is that I simply can't afford to do all of this on my own. As some of you know, I juggle three different teaching jobs while I am in the process of setting up my business, while caring for my husband who has stage 4 cancer. I am good at juggling. I do a LOT of it on my own, but I am learning to ask for help.</p>\n<p>And this is where you come in!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm not looking for donations, I want to give you something in return, which is how pledges work. Think of it as an investment! I need help to fund some of the new materials for this project, which will in turn help put together my sharpest show to date.&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Here is what your pledges will go towards:</span></p>\n<p>- Smooth Buff clay to carve solid clay model forms.</p>\n<p>- Fine potters casting plaster to make plaster moulds.</p>\n<p>- Earthenware casting slip to create the library of new forms and to collate sequence templates. These will be used long term for testing, planning and commissioning, not just for the preparation of this show.</p>\n<p>- Parian slip for casting the final designs. This stuff is utterly gorgeous, slightly self-glazing and deliciously satin smooth. But it is pricy!</p>\n<p>- A range of Nano stains to mix into the slip to create a library of test tiles consisting of the colours and tones I offer. This will enable me to show potential collaborators and customers the colours and tones I offer. But it will also be used for referencing back in the studio for many years to come.</p>\n<p>- Timber and hardwood onto which the ceramics are attached.</p>\n<p>- Marketing material. This is vital for a show of this kind. I will need to ensure I have excellent literature to hand out to potential collaborators and customers. These will be designed and created with the help of my husband Richard, and they will be printed professionally to ensure high quality.&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<p>Any pledges above the funding goal of £600 will be put towards the cost of registering my design for copyright purposes. It will be put towards the cost of travel to/from London for training days and set-up/take-down days. It will go towards putting together press packs. It will go towards getting professional photographs of my work for marketing and the website. Oh and of course I will need to cover the cost of my chocolate supply for the duration of the show - that in itself is pretty substantial!&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Positive Porcelain Pebbles\" data-caption=\"Positive Porcelain Pebbles\" data-id=\"24861489\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Positive Porcelain Pebbles\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/861/489/399e10ee93611118d586934e0aedd404_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1555951514&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c28986ef995ed80ae82f2c32d074ba36\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Positive Porcelain Pebbles</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"'Botanical Series II - Blue' (30cm x 40cm)\" data-caption=\"'Botanical Series II - Blue' (30cm x 40cm)\" data-id=\"24861493\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"'Botanical Series II - Blue' (30cm x 40cm)\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/861/493/61fe22abd2d7dfa881222c6d32700c08_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1555951540&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5bf9e7cb348302db0b5c335a0911c6a3\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">'Botanical Series II - Blue' (30cm x 40cm)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018\" data-caption=\"Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018\" data-id=\"24861500\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/861/500/30db2eb0f3d7e1c8ef1971149742cccb_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1555951589&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d0ff4204640e81b33f89ccec8eeceb15\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018\" data-caption=\"Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018\" data-id=\"24861515\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/861/515/73252a5b92f557818752a08a9f5f1e4e_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1555951652&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a4cd2cdf43fd1e45d27071e2695207c3\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Botanical Installation, Hove Museum 2018</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">There are very few risks and challenges in this project.

The aim of her work is to channel the spirit of nature into manmade spaces, to help soften the symmetrical lines and to radiate the ‘Biophilia Effect’. The intention of her artwork is to address the human instinct for a connection with nature and wilderness.\r\n\r\nShe works with slip casting techniques to build one-off contemporary sculptures, pushing the boundaries of materiality to develop new approaches in her creative processes. Within craft practice, her work aims to emphasise how sculptural contemporary ceramics can and should be integrated more thoughtfully into private and public spaces.\r\n\r\nBekky lives in rural East Sussex, with her studio nestled on a farm. Her daily walks with her dog take her across fields, through woodlands and along beaches, feeding her a steady stream of inspiration.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Rebecca Sarah N May","creator_last_login":1573422111,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.bekkymay.com","domain":"bekkymay.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/859/803/5fd8e193ffaae6449c90451baa27b8ef_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1555941005&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=2aa3057c6c43c87e655bd5c62e73da7d","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1168548628","top_cities_location_1st":"London United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"9","top_cities_location_2st":"Rye United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"3","top_cities_location_3st":"Aylesbury United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_cities_location_4st":"Banbury United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_cities_location_5st":"Battle United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_cities_location_6st":"Brighton United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Canterbury United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Eastbourne United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Gillingham United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Guildford United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United Kingdom","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"27","top_countries_location_2st":"France","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"3","top_countries_location_3st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"3","top_countries_location_4st":"Greece","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_countries_location_5st":"Switzerland","top_countries_number_of_backers_5st":"1","number_of_new_backers":30,"number_of_returning_backers":8}
