I met so many interesting people, I talked with fellow makers and artists sharing tips and contacts, I discussed concepts for commissions and larger scale work, I shared my passion for ceramics and I discussed the fascinating subject of biophilic design. What an incredible opportunity and experience.</p>\n<p>I had the most amazing week and it was only possible thanks to all of you and your generous pledges!</p>\n<p>A week in the city was pretty full on for this country bumpkin. So I have taken a few days off to ‘re-wild’ and come back down to earth. I am now back in the studio, replying to emails, making plans and following up on links. The next chapter begins.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks I will begin making the ceramic pieces for pledges. I’m really looking forward to getting my hands back in the clay and to slow the pace down a bit. I will be in touch with each of you individually when I need addresses for posting your work. This will be over the coming month or two. </p>\n<p>I've added a few photos below to give you a flavour of New Designers. If you haven't yet been, I highly recommend it even if you are not a maker.</p>\n<p>For now, I just want to say a HUGE THANK YOU!!!</p>\n<p>With much love,</p>\n<p>Bekky</p>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Pre-show set up\" data-caption=\"Pre-show set up\" data-id=\"25709952\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pre-show set up\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/709/952/a8b4694f58c802fa348257e4e2a02878_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1562324359&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4f48f5a6eb6762e6b3948913c61afa59\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pre-show set up</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"My stand.
