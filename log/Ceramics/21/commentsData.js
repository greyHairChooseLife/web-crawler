Using them almost daily, I just wanted to post some feedback regarding these in the hopes of bringing improvement to Trevor's upcoming projects in the future.\n\nThe negatives:\n- I wish the cups help more liquid than they do. They hold a comfortable 250 mL (8.5 oz) but can go right up to the rim at 300 mL (10.0 oz). Therefore not the 360 mL (12.0 oz) as described.\n- They are heat magnets!!! Too darn hot to handle once you've brewed a fresh cup of coffee or tea. You have recourse to no other alternative than to wait for your beverage to cool before being able to pick it up and have a drink from it. The front end of the skull, which protrudes a little is also hot. As I did not order the handled version of these, I am curious to know if the handles help in any way. If they are made from the same clay material used for the main body of the cup, I highly doubt these will prevent heat from reaching the handles.\n- That's basically it.\n\nThe pros:\n- The details and uniqueness in both of these cups are astounding. I just love the look and feel (not so much my wife). The craftsmanship and amount of dedication put in these from Trevor are not unnoticed.\n- The cup feels nice to hold and has some weight to it which gives it a solid feel. They do not feel cheap.\n- It feels weird to state, given as these are bare-boned skull mugs, but they feel delightful to drink from.\n\nThings to consider for future projects:\n- Trevor created an idea and executed it brilliantly! My only goal is to provide constructive feedback so that he can judge for himself whether to implement it or not.\n- Increase the cup\\s liquid holding capacity to 360 mL (12.0 oz). Perhaps the drying process reduces the space available inside the cup?\n- Implement holding regions on the exterior of the cups with heat resistant material (i.e. silicone). I understand that this might affect the aesthetics of the cup itself, but this would improve the functioning of the cup towards hot beverages. Removable silicone hairdo attached to the temporal and occipital bones maybe? \n\nI have no regrets in backing this project and thank Trevor for the hard work and dedication he's still putting into bringing these to the remaining backer's hand.\n\nPics:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/phewy8Y","createdAt":1607279832,"author":{"id":"VXNlci01NzY0NjEzMDg=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/266/097/fb094af6aaced2ef55398741fb7cd1d4_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1461377292&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=f010ed206075741163882ffbfc81e500","name":"Bart Bohu","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/576461308"},"replies":{"totalCount":1,"nodes":[{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0zMDg3NTc1NA==","body":"Thanks for your feedback.

For this reward you would need to pledge for the 2X mug and then send me a message in the 'rewards survey' at end of the campaign that says you would like to change one to a cup. I believe this should be a $99 pledge including shipping. Hope that makes sense.
