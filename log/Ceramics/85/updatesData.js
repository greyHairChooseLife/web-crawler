Assuming everything makes it safely through the two kiln firings in the weeks ahead, I have finished the bulk of the gift making! Ideally, shipping will begin at the end of this month -- well ahead of my December prediction. Huzzah! Even with kiln delays... all the unexpected delays. I'm sending around the surveys in the week ahead to gather the rest of the addresses, so please fill those out to avoid delays in the month ahead.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Speaking of delays... The pottery studio has also been put on an (excruciating, if I'm being honest) pause for reasons out of our control. Surveys and soil scientists had to be called in, and we live in a county with departments closing and a single employee doing this work... Such as it goes in these rural counties. We are eager to get restarted, and luckily (always looking for that silver lining) I will have my attention more fully on the project with the bulk of my work completed. There is still glazing and shipping, of course, but I see the light at the end of the gift tunnel. It's been a crazy amount of work, and I'm proud of how I've continued to show up over the past few months. It's the biggest undertaking I've ever taken on, and I'm so happy to see it all coming to fruition.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Once again, I just want to extend my deepest gratitude for making this dream a reality for me. I will keep you all updated as things continue! We can't wait to get our hands back on the studio project.
