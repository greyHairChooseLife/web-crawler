I’ve always wanted to try so many different things, but I never had the opportunities to do so. Part of my younger years I spent out in Axson in Atkinson County. Even 18 years ago, there wasn’t much to do around this area. I wound up getting pregnant (with my now 16-year-old) during my Junior year in high school. I wound up living on my own, paying my bills, and finishing high school on my own. I was living on my own at 16 years old with an infant. \r\n\r\nAfter high school, I moved in with her father. He was a Marine at the time (also from Pearson) and was stationed at Parris Island in South Carolina. I had my son when I was 19 years old. A few years later my husband at the time was getting out of the Marines. He was getting medically discharged. I knew I had to do something to be able to provide for my children, so I joined the Army. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Their father wound up getting out and not getting a job. So he had to go. I spent seven years out of my 8-year enlistment as a single parent in the military.  A lot of my time in the military was spent away from my children.  I deployed to Iraq for 15 months and was the medic for an EOD (explosives ordnance disposal) security team.  My second deployment was to Afghanistan where I assisted in running a clinic for the area. \r\n\r\nI got out of the Army after meeting my current husband because it was time to go to college and be a mom again. I waited until my ETS date and got out of the Army as a Sergeant (E5) with full honors, two deployments under my belt, and a ton of valuable life skills. My husband and I decided it was time to get our degrees and move on in the civilian world. I started attending Western Carolina University in North Carolina that summer (we got out in March of 2014). I graduated in 3 ½ years with two Bachelor degrees in Marketing and Management. My youngest daughter decided to come into our lives in the middle of my college journey. I still attended classes while pregnant and maintained a 3.3 GPA. When she was born, I only missed three days of school. \r\n\r\nI’m telling you this because this shows my determination. I have beaten the odds over and over again throughout my life. I am motivated and determined to make things work.  \r\n\r\nCeramics came into my life during college. I started out taking a drawing class to learn more techniques and moved into ceramics. This changed my life. I took all four classes (four different skill level classes) in ceramics but continued my degrees in Marketing and Management. I felt like this would give me more tools that I could use in the future instead of pursuing an art degree. \r\n\r\nAfter I graduated college this past December, we ran into rough times. But we have been putting ourselves (my husband and I both) through college with three kids.  It hasn't been easy for us, but we have pulled through.  My husband graduates next month.  It's time to move onto the next chapter and my mission is to get this studio going and to help others who suffer like I have.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Jacqueline Worthington","creator_last_login":1526031875,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":2,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":2,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/worthingtonpottery/","domain":"facebook.com"},{"url":"https://www.etsy.com/shop/WorthingtonPottery","domain":"etsy.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/943/408/a54918fc09e70b880ae33624c333c7da_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1524844251&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1576948b05e36bf86609162f7580184b","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/583103367","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>I am raising these funds as a downpayment for a studio located in Waycross, GA.&nbsp; These funds will cover the downpayment for the loan I need and closing costs on the building I have located.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My mission in life is to help Veterans in one way or another.&nbsp; I was a combat medic for 8 years in the Army and got out to go to college full time and to spend more time at home with my children.&nbsp; Recent events in my life have opened my eyes to PTSD and the many versions it can take.&nbsp; I have started a movement called \"throwing for PTSD\" (#throwingforptsd).&nbsp; I want this movement to bring more attention to PTSD, the issues it causes, and ways that we can cope with the symptoms.&nbsp; I have had a close friend of mine lose her battle with this disease and I almost lost mine.&nbsp; I'm one of the lucky ones though and I know I am still here for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My PTSD doesn't just stem from the military though.&nbsp; PTSD is created in many forms but is treatable.&nbsp; I have found my therapy in my art and my mission.&nbsp; I want to share the things I have learned over the years with others who suffer like I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My studio will also be open to the public so I can generate more revenue.&nbsp; I will offer a studio that the customers can come to and make beautiful pieces of art along with creating family fun.&nbsp; The city of Waycross doesn't have anything for families to do recreationally.&nbsp; The bowling alley and skating rink have closed because the owners wanted to retire.&nbsp; The owners aren't willing to sell yet either.&nbsp; This makes the families of Waycross travel to other locations for family fun.&nbsp; The closest thing would be the jump park and sports park in Douglas, GA.&nbsp; This is still a 30-minute drive from Waycross.&nbsp; The closest competition I will have will be in Brunswick, GA (about an hour away).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">My risks are low with this project.
