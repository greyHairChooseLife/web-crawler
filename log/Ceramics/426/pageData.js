Each Japanese Ceramics piece is unique, with no two pieces looking the same.</p>\n<p>We draw inspiration from Japanese ancient ideals: wabi (transient and stark beauty), sabi (the beauty of natural patina and aging), and yūgen (profound grace and subtlety). These ideals are visible in much of Japanese cultural and aesthetic norms, and also in our cups and bowls!</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"27845169\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/845/169/03e1b0b17b4400214b49cea2ece89789_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1579820363&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ed67a0fbc2b02ea844164acded914682\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>You can choose between <span class=\"bold\">small bowls or soy jars.</span> The bowls can be used for tea, dessert, youghurt, snacks&nbsp; – or whatever you want!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">As we don't rely on a factories to produce for us, we don't foresee any major hurdles that could delay production significantly.
