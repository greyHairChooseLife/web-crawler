I'm truly sorry about this, I thought that I would be able to sent a shipping notification once the pledge is marked as shipped. Backerkit said that in the survey status you will be able to see if your pledge has shipped or not, <strong>'If you need to review your status, you can return to your survey by clicking the link in your survey email or requesting your survey link under \"Lost your survey?\" on our BackerKit project page at https://seedling-planters.backerkit.com.'. </strong>\n</li>\n  <li>Shipping has started for everywhere, I've had a few questions about this but yes Canada, Germany, France etc - everywhere is being sent out!</li>\n  <li>Please note that as mentioned in the campaign, these are <strong>handpainted</strong>, each planter will be slightly unique and different. They aren't manufactured goods where every one is done by machine. However if you feel that you received a defective planter please send an email to hello@leikya.com</li>\n  <li>One batch of shipments accidentally had autumn leaf saucers instead of paw saucers, if you received this please send an email to hello@leikya.com with photos so I can get this fixed for you!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you all again for the support with this!

Unfortunately, on the 27th I was told that production would be delayed again due to lack of workers. China is currently having problems with Covid outbreaks and lockdowns so I believe that may be the cause. They originally wanted to extend it a month but they've agreed to 2 weeks since it had already been delayed. The safety of the workers is the most important thing, and I also still want to prioritise the quality of the planters so if they need an extra week or two I'd prefer they have that than rushing it. I've been told they're at the glazing stage though so definitely the final stretch!
