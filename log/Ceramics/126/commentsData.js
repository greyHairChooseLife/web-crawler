I also really like that they come with a silicone plug for the drainage hole. \n\nSome minor nitpicks, really nothing to stress out about but might be improved upon:\n\n- The drainage holes are all in different places, not in the center of the pots, on one planter it is only a cm off to the side\n- One planter was glazed with some leftover pieces / scraps still in it, it isn't a lot but earth will easily accumulate under it / in the cracks\n- I personally would have liked the pad / frog and leaf / fox colors to be a bit more similar but I understand that they weren’t necessarily made “in pairs”\n- The packaging was made out of Styrofoam, while I appreciate that custom shaped objects are hard to protect in transport, a sustainable / recyclable solution would have been nice\n- I never got a tracking number / shipping confirmation, my email on the label was correct but my phone number wasn’t (just a “0”)\n\nTL;DR, very nice, Q&A / minor details could be improved upon.\n\nThanks a lot for you work, I wish you all the success in this and future endeavors!

If I didnt I would have cancelled months ago. It is also really rude to just say if someone is not ok with your blatent lack of communication they should just cancel. \nSecondly: The deleted comment. Actually if I remember correctly, there were two comments of you in response to Tom Asmussen. One was adressing him and then one where you responded to Stephanie Dieck and I. There are not there anymore, for whatever reason.\nThirdly: communication. People are asking for updates so you should update them on the platform they pledged on, not on twitter. Even if there is nothing new, when you say you post an update soon just do it. Many people before me have said that they wanted more frequent updates, we want to be \"spammed\" with updates (i would not consider weekly updates spamming though).

I'm guessing it was someone who I refunded their pledge, as that hides all their comments/the responses to it\n\nI do agree my communication has not been the best, especially through the earlier stages of the project. Honestly I was just a bit shaken at how many things had gone wrong and I wanted to try and either fix it or see what could be fixed before each update, but doing that delayed the updates as I have to wait on responses from other sources. I am definitely not the best at communication in general and I am truly sorry for the stress/trouble that caused. For the recent updates, I meant spamming as in because I'm waiting for information the two updates could be right after each other rather than weekly. I'm also keeping in mind 2000 people have received their planters, so again I wanted to post only when I have enough information to update. I thought posting updates in the Kickstarter comments was a good middle ground as well as Twitter as I have mentioned in previous updates that I will post more frequent updates there. Again I am sorry for the frustration, if I end up doing more Kickstarters to take pre-orders for a product in the future then I will add a disclaimer that updates may not be as frequent as other projects, so hopefully that will give people the choice beforehand.","createdAt":1651142919,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xMjcwMjc4OTQ0","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/609/283/b8bd9614cecf2e0f955c25ca3de03b9e_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1611938325&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=5ab48ffd9336985e2f18d2b1d7cc093b","name":"leikya","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/leikya"}},{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0zNjUxNjgxNQ==","body":"I appreciate your update here in the comments.

This way, the updates were not repetitive. Plus, there’s also the ‘comments’ section to help answer our questions).

I think the way I explained it was confusing without examples, though I think it worked itself out. So I pledged £32 (£30 for the planter + £12 for the saucer), and on the survey, after I selected the planter I wanted, it said I had £5 credit for an add-on, with the shipping fee being £7 and already taken out of the £12 credit after the initial £20 pledge; when I added on the saucer, the shipping was bumped up to £12, but it worked out so that I just owed £12 on top of the initial pledge. So it makes sense in the end, I think I was just confused at first when it told me I only had £5 credit after the shipping based on just the planter without add-ons was taken into account, if that makes sense!","createdAt":1616570932,"author":{"id":"VXNlci05ODM4MjM4OQ==","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=38b545eeac1249d5d25c87db69d5ee12","name":"xan","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/98382389"}},{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0zMjAyNDM3Mg==","body":"Oh I see!
