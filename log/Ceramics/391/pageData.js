I used all sorts of materials. I loved and still love using my hands to create.</p><p>When I got to my senior year of high school I took my first ceramics class. It was a hand building class where I made candle holders, a piggy bank, bowls and much more. This is when I began to fall in love with ceramics. It was a way to take something as simple as clay and turn it into something to use and enjoy.</p><p>In college at Ohio University I took another hand building class. I made a tray, a lion with a man's face and a zipper enlarged to almost two feet. I loved taking my time and putting in the work to add every detail. I was lucky enough to have my ceramic zipper accepted into the Undergraduate Art exhibit that year. Even more amazing, I won the President's Prize in Art!</p><p>The next quarter I got to take my first throwing class. This proved to be difficult for me. I was always too afraid to make walls too thin. The results were cups and mugs and bowls that were very small with thick walls causing them to be heavy. However, I did feel that I did very well when glazing, getting to experiment with many colors and mixtures. I'm excited to practice more and get much better.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately this was my last opportunity with ceramics classes at OU.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Once I am funded I plan to purchase my supplies.
