I am 48 yrs old and married to a hard working and supportive husband.&nbsp;</p><p>My Husband and I have guardianship of our 7 yr old granddaughter who came out of a very desperate and abusive situation. In order to provide for her, as well as her future, I would like to start a full  time business with a possibility of opening a physical location at some point.</p><p>I have had a passion for art all my life and wanted to open my own business since i a was little. I also have prior business management skills as well.&nbsp;thus with that being said, I started my small business called Sheri's Jewelry N Glass.&nbsp;</p><p>We offer an alternative to the mass produced Jewelry and Home Decor gifts found in most malls and gift shops.&nbsp;</p><p>For the Artisan Jewelry - &nbsp;I hope to create something beautiful that speaks to your personality; it could be a possible conversation piece; However, making it affordable for the pocketbook.&nbsp;</p><p>For the Home and Garden department - We only have special and unique pontil marked vases from USA Glass Blowing artists no mass produced cookie cutter nor imported stuff here!!\n The Ponitl Mark and air bubbles generally represent a handmade pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>A Pontil mark or punt mark is the scar where the pontil, punty or punt was broken from a work of blown glass. The presence of such a scar indicates that a glass bottle or bowl was blown freehand, while the absence of a punt mark suggests either that the mark has been obliterated or that the work was mold-blown. (wikipedia)</p><p>For the Garden -&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going green and creating unique garden decorations from recycled or upcycled vintage dishes that I find at estate&nbsp;sales and vintage stores.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to be unique in the things I do, and make it my own. If you google bird feeders or windchimes you will find traditional styles and etc. However I am combining the 2 with vintage dishes to give that unique feel.</p><p>Right now we have a very limited amount of supplies and tools and rarely find a limited amount of materials and supplies that we can afford on craigslist. we need extra money for supplies, materials, tools, and marketing, and etc; having the materials you need as an artist is a must but I am doing the best I can with what I currently have.&nbsp;</p><p>If you check out my etsy store (sherisjewelrynglass) you will see I put my heart into each and every unique piece.\n\nI have found good suppliers at a nice cost for quality materials however everything is way out of our budget;Unfortunately the better deals on supplies are on bulk purchases (over $400 at once) and not on smaller purchases. I try and be creative as I can with what I have.</p><p>My only hope out of this whole thing is to be able to have a little extra per month so I can help teach our granddaughter what a positive role model should be, as well as, teaching her about setting goals and achieving them. \n\nI want her to know even though she came from a bad situation she can over come it and make something for herself, as well as, that hard work is a positive; Thus by helping around the store and helping with the designs, this will encourage the positive behaviors and rewards (she already packages orders for shipping and enjoys it :-)...this will allow me to possibly have something to hand down to her one day so she can become the responsible adult she needs to be.\n\n&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to personally thank everyone who helps us with this task. as grandparents we are truly grateful and blessed to have this opportunity to break the cycle; Having this store will allow the artist in both of us to grow.. I truly believe if we have the correct tools, supplies and etc. our creations will look unique and beautiful.</p><div>\n</div></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Risks: - not many - mostly if suppliers are being late with shipping, and ads don't go out in time. \r\n\r\nChallenges: - I need power tools (Ie miter saw, vise, etc.) and supplies Crystals, beads, gemstone slabs etc.) , Marketing and etc.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":4,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Sheri's Jewelry and Glass bumper Sticker</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-09-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sep 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 20</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Sheri's Jewelry N Glass Bumper Sticker and a  Thank you letter mention posted on our etsy Store about us page.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-06-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Jun 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Sheri's Jewelry N Glass Bumper Sticker and a  Thank you letter mention posted on our etsy Store about us page, 1 outdoor garden decoration.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Sheri's Jewelry N Glass Bumper Sticker and a  Thank you letter mention posted on our etsy Store about us page;
