He lived overseas and worked for a pottery studio as a production potter. He always had a dream of starting a pottery studio for the community. When returning to the states he was asked to start a studio with a friend and the business grew from that. Joel lives in Reamstown, PA with his wife and 5 children. They enjoy working together to grow the business and see artists inspired to grow their gift.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Joel  Hildebrand","creator_last_login":1568898311,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.inspirepotterystudio.com","domain":"inspirepotterystudio.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/006/629/97029b5bfe045475dbfebb61a113b87e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1564715375&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=fd66937ab6b13a5060a2a9e95ff1103f","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/inspire2019","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Inspire Pottery Studio has &nbsp;been in business since November 2018, and we are excited about how it's growing. We have lots of people taking one-time classes or trying a 6 week course. We have had over 450 students go through a class or classes and have had 21 studio members to this point.&nbsp;Members are artists who use our facility and its equipment but don't need lessons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We love the community that has been created, &nbsp;we inspire each other in our work! It is such a fun atmosphere to be in and we would love to see it continue! At this point we are firing a kiln (if not two) a day. The kilns we have are small and a lot of our studio potters (including myself) love to make big pieces. The problem is, because of their size, they can't be fired in any of the kilns we currently have. &nbsp;We also need a large kiln to get pieces fired faster. We are raising funds to build a big wood-fired kiln outside and a larger gas or electric kiln for inside. This will allow us to fire more pieces in one firing and allow more firing options for our students. Please help us achieve this goal!</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Hanging planter\" data-id=\"26254492\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/254/492/285aa7d4d0d95d22793f2c378e0737a5_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1566783533&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=251808e6623b35f8e7aebe5fd2d16000\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Hanging planter</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Overlap bowl\" data-id=\"26322119\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/322/119/ea3db959cec08b8fe54c96a5c66450e0_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1567303856&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=89575d601228b75e278b75377c7a6916\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Overlap bowl</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Overlap bowl picture 2\" data-id=\"26322121\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/322/121/330f23b7cdf68ffa3e4e6b7e5c412bd5_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1567303901&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=133061d149893d6b583cd34718591951\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Overlap bowl picture 2</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Date Night\" data-id=\"26205425\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/205/425/0bea23ae847a8021973abc38d039db3f_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1566350474&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b3bb50731890e84ccb9a0fa657fe9d8a\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Date Night</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Pottery party group of 5\" data-id=\"26182719\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/182/719/61ffc2dc2d9d2ba40dd333980c375d9e_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1566178673&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=03099f39cda5cd9b4f256274a4ffebd8\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pottery party group of 5</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Pottery party of 10 AND custom piece!\" data-id=\"26217016\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/217/016/16d64f3874ce11231345c10b844d6c12_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1566435645&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b4310f2ff846101aa3495e9246a42299\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pottery party of 10 AND custom piece!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">One of the potential risks involved would be the actual making of the wood fired kiln.
