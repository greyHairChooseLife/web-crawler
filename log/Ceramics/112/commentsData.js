I‚Äôve currently backed for the Chawan bowl, but wondered if I could pledge more money in this category to have a larger chawan bowl with a spout for tea preparation (or a teapot that would stylistically be comparable) and four smaller chawan cups that fit in one‚Äôs hand with no spouts (akin to the current description). How much extra would I need to pledge to receive these rewards (if possible)?
