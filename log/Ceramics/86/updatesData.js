When Kyle and I decided to start city mud we knew it would come with its challenges, and we tried our best to get ahead of any foreseeable problems. We spoke to a business coach, we ran our financial numbers, we got advice from as many people as we could, and we reached out to the city of Denver to see what permits we would need to obtain for our business. When we signed our lease in mid August we applied for the permits we were directed to apply for and set off to wait the 12 weeks until they would pass. This past week, we found out that while our zoning permit was accepted (a win!) our electrical permit is being withheld as the city decided we need a complete change of occupancy to open our doors. This means that we need an architect and engineers of various trades to put together stamped drawings of our portion of the building. These drawings will then be reviewed by the Architectural, Mechanical/Plumbing, Zoning, Electrical, Fire, and Wastewater Departments. Once these drawings are reviewed, and necessary inspections take place, we should be fully in the clear with the city and able to open our doors. However, because we are in a very old  building, applying for an occupancy permit can open a can of worms with the city that we hope to avoid. We believe that we can navigate all of this with the help of the right team, but the situation is still nerve wracking, and very unexpected.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Right now we are looking for the right architect who has experience working with Denver County to help us move through this process smoothly and quickly. If anyone has a lead there- please let us know! We have a few people we are talking to, but we want to make sure we find the right person for this (very important) job. If everything goes well we should get a response from the city a  few weeks following the submission of our drawings. All of this being said,  even in the best case scenario we can’t expect to open before December first, with classes beginning in the new year. We can’t tell you how much we wish we could open tomorrow, and how challenging it is to keep delivering bad news. We’re telling ourselves that good things take time and we believe that city mud will be a good example of that. We’ve got the space, the people, the clay, and the spirit, so now it's just a means of waiting a little longer for this good thing to begin.</p>\n<p>That being said, if you have any follow up questions, concerns, or worries concerning a kickstarter class or membership spot please send us an email and we can work out a solution with you.And if you ordered a kickstarter pot, don’t worry, those will be out  before the holidays. We want to thank everyone for being so patient with us through this process and its wild ups and downs- it’s been such a gift to feel the support of our clay community.</p>\n<p>Happy Halloween!</p>\n<p>Emily &amp; Kyle</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1663080730,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"28701.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"41422.2","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":241,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1661799410,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTM1OTQ3MjU=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"we've met our goal!!","publishedAt":1661799410,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"city mud","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/070/117/493bb9c3b90c919f5da6df99868404c7_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1650664429&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=9c11555ddb5c0e00ea21fcde5091a398","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":12,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>We've met our kickstarter goal! And we are so <em>incredibly</em> grateful to all of you for helping us get here. Reaching our goal in less than a week was such a huge vote of confidence for city mud, and such a great reminder of all of the support Kyle and I have in our lives. The kickstarter has wildly exceeded our expectations thus far- we reached our goal in 5 days, we sold out of all 30 of our beginner classes, set up a 20 person waitlist,  sold 22 memberships slots, and reached so many people in Denver who want to work with clay.</p>\n<p>Right now we are in the throws of renovating our space- we've demoed walls, painted ceilings, repaired old doors, and scraped linoleum flooring off of cement for countless hours. We're working every day (and night) to make this space the community studio we want city mud to be, and we cannot wait to open our doors. Renovating the space on our own and with the help of gracious friends and family is a big task, but it is also so rewarding to see the work pay off as our space changes for the better.</p>\n<p>We were especially grateful to exceed our kickstarter goal this past week as we ran into issues with our electrical and heating. While we've got everything together now and can solve the problems, having extra financial padding from the kickstarter has brought big relief. When we set our kickstarter goal we aimed for the bare minimum we needed to get going, and if opening a business has taught us anything its that nothing ever goes exactly as planned, and nothing ever <em>costs </em>exactly what you think it will. It's not always smooth sailing out here, but that's okay. If everything continues to go generally as planned, we hope to open our doors by the beginning of October! And we'll keep everyone who purchased a class or membership very in the loop as we begin to know more about the opening. And in our rare spare moments I am cooking up those pots for everyone who got one!</p>\n<p>Our big ask now is that you all continue to share our kickstarter and tell your friends about city mud, especially if you're local to Denver. Having more financial assurance, and having more eyes on our business as we begin to open our doors would be such a massive help. We're 5k away from 40k, and that last push could expedite our process of opening in a big, big way.</p>\n<p>Thank you all so very much for all of your help, we can't even tell you how incredibly grateful we are that we have this much support in opening city mud.</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1660315934,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"28701.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"41422.2","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":241,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
