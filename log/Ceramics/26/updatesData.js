We are tying up loose ends over here at the new studio (more on that soon), and sending out a final update to let you know that, according to our records, we have sent out all of our rewards ! That being said, Kickstarter was a little tricky to keep track of pledgers who pledged for more than one thing, so if you didn't get everything that you pledged for, or we somehow checked you off our list by accident, *please let us know* so we can get your item out to you !</p>\n<p>For the few of you that have not been able to attend the organized workshops, I am about to be in touch with you directly to give you a discount code that can be applied in the online shop for the amount pledged for the workshop. We still have a couple private workshops to organize, so please be in touch over email at studio@simonebodmerturner.com to schedule !</p>\n<p>Updates from Brooklyn: As of February 2020, the space next door to our current space became available and I signed a second lease to expand into a brighter, bigger space that will be completely my own. We built a door into the room that is the kiln room of the old space, to connect the two spaces. The goal is, over the next 6 months, to turn the open industrial space into both a sculpture studio and by-appointment showroom. Because the space opened up much sooner than expected, I am opening the space up for photoshoot and event rentals, to cushion the cost of the new investment until I can work through my commissions and focus on building out the space the way I envision it. If you have friends, clients, or contacts in New York looking for a whitewashed industrial space for a shoot or event, the listing can be found on <a href=\"https://www.peerspace.com/pages/listings/5e4efa21c2c098000c3fa5f8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Peerspace</a>. </p>\n<p>Additionally, we are looking to add two positions to the team, a full-time Head Studio Tech to run the production of the Permanent Collection of vessels, and a part-time Studio Manager to help with paperwork, invoicing, press and purchase inquiries, etc. If you know anyone in the Brooklyn/Manhattan/Queens area that might be a great fit, please have them take a look at the postings on <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=simone+bodmer-turner&amp;l=New+York%2C+NY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indeed</a>. </p>\n<p>Thank so you so much for an incredible run, and for being a foundational part of the growth of this studio and my practice. I couldn't have done it without you.</p>\n<p>All my gratitude, and the best to each of you,</p>\n<p>Simone</p>\n<p>PS: Photos of the new space below !</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"28283283\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/283/283/b431fdd4ffb4ea937ecc55fb018b4d39_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1583103794&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ff45210b897dcf5cae31d13aa321c37d\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"28283298\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/283/298/d0d2c3c6f90b00d3634c89bbabd73cb6_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1583103877&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2aee7ce4739a8bf54d4c0d43e95db98f\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"28283303\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/283/303/dfa4cc03ba636957336a3882af6393f2_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1583103903&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e4f09bbb1408853c0b8b0ef8a0a649f3\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1553610790,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI0NTk0Nzk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Update #11 - Design Weeks + New Workshop Dates","publishedAt":1553610790,"pinnedAt":null,"number":11,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Simone Bodmer-Turner","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/925/582/12af99888ca126ffe3b22cdaef32aa2d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1539765933&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1ddc1412fd5c2e8d68742b4bd8559bf8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":2,"body":"<p>Hi All !</p>\n<p>A couple exciting things to note. First, I've now hosted the first two workshops in the space, and it's been such a lovely experience. My hosting gene is glowing having everyone enjoy the space, get to touch clay, enjoy a meal together, and meet one another. I partnered with florist <a href=\"https://foxfodderfarm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox Fodder Farm</a> for last weekend's workshop, and it so nice to tag team a day together; working with flowers in the morning, and getting to build a vessel for an arrangement in the afternoon. It was loose, it was fun, it was communal. If you've purchased a workshop through Kickstarter but we have not been in touch yet about attending, please do let me know if any of the upcoming dates work for you. Dates listed below:</p>\n<p>Immersive Handbuilding Workshop : April 27th-28th</p>\n<p>1 Day Handbuilding Workshop : May 18th</p>\n<p>Form &amp; Floral Workshop : June 9th</p>\n<p>Secondly, I've been asked to show work in two design shows in Milan for Salone and one in New York for NY Design Week. In Milan, I will be showing the first preview of new sculptural work with <a href=\"http://www.meetmyproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meet My Project</a>, and pieces from my Permanent Collection of Vessels with <a href=\"http://se-collections.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sé </a>. In May in New York, I will be installing an entire collection of this new body of sculptural work alongside the <a href=\"https://www.noguchi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Noguchi Museum</a> at <a href=\"https://totokaelo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Totokaelo</a>. I am humbled and excited to have these opportunities to show my work alongside talented designers, and the work of a sculptor who has been incredibly influential to my work. If you are in Milan for Salone or New York for Design Week, please do reach out !</p>\n<p>All of these opportunities also mean that the creation of the rewards for Kickstarter are moving slower than I hoped. I have almost finished all the smaller rewards, but still need to get all the salt dishes and spoons, and a couple of the moon bowls out to pledgers. Once I am back from Milan in mid April, I will get working on the larger rewards while I work on the pieces for New York Design Week. After New York Design Week in mid May, I will finally be able to focus on the custom commissions for Kickstarters, the largest vessels ordered through this campaign, and organize the private workshops.</p>\n<p>That is all to say that I am completely committed to fulfilling every single reward offered in this campaign, and will deliver them to you or host you by the end of this summer. I believe I'll be able to get back on track with timeline by the end of May, but the rewards that were supposed to be delivered in April and May, may be arriving closer to the beginning of June. Thank you all very much for your patience and support, please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns. </p>\n<p>With gratitude,</p>\n<p>Simone</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1549906513,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI0MTI5MDg=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Project Update #10 - Progress !","publishedAt":1549906513,"pinnedAt":null,"number":10,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Simone Bodmer-Turner","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/925/582/12af99888ca126ffe3b22cdaef32aa2d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1539765933&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1ddc1412fd5c2e8d68742b4bd8559bf8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":5,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Hello all !</p>\n<p>I write to you from Mexico City, where I am for the art fairs, and all the incredibly interesting projects being shown that incorporate native materials like volcanic rock, onyx, agave fiber, corn husks, and local clay.

We hired on a full time studio assistant and the addition of his hands has expedited the process significantly, and as soon as I'm caught up on orders and Kickstarter rewards, his help will allow me to focus my time on building new work and larger scale sculpture and lighting installations. Having control over the kiln firings means that I've been able to program a specific cycle - where essentially the kiln cools very very slowly rather than at the natural speed that it would drop if it turned itself off after it hits its peak temperature - allowing the glaze to be a very creamy, buttery, warm white matte that I haven't been able to achieve since I was in residency at Saipua and running my own kilns.

Hector Zamora installed 700 still-wet earthenware vessels from the clay workshops of Metpec at <a href=\"http://www.labor.org.mx/portfolio/movimientos-emisores-de-existencia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Labor</a>, the gallery across the street from the Luis Barragan house &amp; studio. At the opening, which I regrettably was not yet in Mexico for, 6 women moved through and stomped on the pieces in a performance of their cathartic re-claiming of space in a patriarchal society. Curator, Paola Santoscoy, expands on this...</p>\n<p><em>\"Movimientos Exisores de Existencia (Existence-Emitting Movements) emerges from a facination from the iconic figure of a woman bearing a vessel on her head to transport water or food, which then unfolds into multiple possibilities for transporting almost anything on the head in ergonomic perfection that is entirely efficient, elegant and sensual. Zamora has spent several years collecting an endless number of image of people from different eras and regions of the world carrying something on their heads, as a way of using the image to insist on an exploration of carrying and the strength it represents. As it is a task historically assigned to women accross many cultures the feminine figure becomes the focal point of this action in which Zamora disrupts the order of things by placing the vessel not upon the women's heads but rather at their feet. By inverting the equation what occurs is the creation of a \"shared space\". </em></p>\n<p><em>The vessels come from a ceramic workshop in Metepec, Mexico State. The different shapes chosen by the artist are shapes that the workshop regularly produces, so there is no stylization added to these utilitarian objects. The only variation is that they have not been fired. In several regions throughout the country these vessels can be found in different tones and types of clay, and the tradition of bearing them on the head remains the same. This is a highly cultured object that is very present in the imaginary, to the extend that its malleability within this situation - or perhaps better stated, its availability to be transformed -  works on a symbolic level. The rigidity of fired terra cotta becomes flexible through the footsteps of these women who leave new forms in their wake, who exert their weight and freedom of choice with how hard they stem, weather they participate or not, in a kind of playful, collective catharsis.\"</em></p>\n<p> There is very little footage to be found, but a friend of mine was at the opening and gives you a glimpse of the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtgoIsfl0FP/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">performative opening</a>. The smashed and altered remnants of the pots and the clay footprints of the women have been left as an installation at Labor for the upcoming weeks.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for your support and patience. Wishing you each a wonderful week.</p>\n<p>With gratitude, </p>\n<p>Simone</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24057096\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/057/096/7ff34c9a4cedff64597bfcfd3bcb52b8_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1549905515&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=fa8f7d76d856ed783e64f83dee73f3e5\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24057107\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/057/107/a7636653e86725f770f5c07cb5dcedad_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1549905553&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=61316a1916de30ca9d60c62bb61a82aa\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24057119\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/057/119/1bff05bf7d7867e2561449eef15a46d0_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1549905584&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6cc23ab31ff4dff648df839168154dc4\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1545022865,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIzNzA5NTA=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Project Update # 9 - 2019 Workshops !","publishedAt":1545022865,"pinnedAt":null,"number":9,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Simone Bodmer-Turner","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/925/582/12af99888ca126ffe3b22cdaef32aa2d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1539765933&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1ddc1412fd5c2e8d68742b4bd8559bf8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Hello all !</p><p>I hope you have been able to hunker down a bit and have had some moments of calm in what can be one of the wildest times of the year.

We hope you will be able to make it to both workshops, but also know that committing to two consecutive weekends is a lot, so it <i>is</i> possible to just choose the Form Workshop (which will be similar to the 1 Day Handbuilding Workshop, with a focus on functional vessels for florals) or just the Floral Workshop if you are not able to commit to both !</p><p>There are also a couple spaces left in the <b>1 Day Handbuilding Workshop on March 9</b>, and the <b>Weekend Long Immersive Handbuilding Workshop on April 27-28th</b>.

There are careful stitches and patches throughout, and two different patterns on each side. It is in excellent shape and can certainly be used, or it would be beautiful hung as a wall piece.The square in the center means that it was originally put over a <i>kotatsu</i> - a squat square table that is heated from underneath to keep warm in the cold winters in old Japanese homes with paper windows. Originally, and when this blanket would have been used, the heat came from a square hole cut in the ground where coals would go, and a grate would be placed over it. You would hang your legs into the hole and the the blanket falling over the sides of the table would keep the heat in and your legs warm. In contrast to the photo I found of a <i>kotatsu</i> from the 1890's (below) the center cut out either allowed the table top to show through and still be functional, or to make it easier for a piece of wood to sit on top of the blanket as a table top. As the weather has grown chillier here, our <i>kotatsu</i> has become the center of our little farmhouse, for meals, reading, talking, and napping, though these days they are often electric heaters.</p><p><b>AUCTION : HOW IT WORKS</b></p><p>To enter your name into the pool of bidders for the Boro piece, please select the new reward \"Auction Bid\" for a $10 pledge, or increase your existing pledge by $10. Unlike what the word \"auction\" suggests, the highest bidder will not be the one to receive the piece - <b>every bid will be counted equally and the recipient will be selected at random in order to keep this democratic</b>. Though of course, any additional amounts are very welcome and appreciated, a bid is an equal entry into the pool regardless of amount.  <b>All $10+ increases in pledges and new $10+ pledges made for \"Auction Bid\" between 8am Sunday EST and midnight on Monday EST will be considered a bid and will enter your name into a pool where the recipient of the piece will be selected at random. </b>To make this economical for me and this campaign, <b>the auction will only move forward if 50 supporters make this pledge</b>. So looking forward to sharing this gorgeous piece.

I hope that the visiting artists series &amp; lectures I will be hosting will not be contained to artists that are easily able to get to New York on their own dime. I dream of bringing up one of the women potters I worked with in Oaxaca and having her teach a weekend long hand building workshop, alongside a chef who specializes in traditional dishes from Oaxaca for a completely immersive Oaxaqueno experience. In circumstances like this, it would be such a gift to be able to offer to pay for plane tickets and accommodation, rather than hand that off to the pottery collective, which would be very difficult for them to manage, and uncomfortable for me to ask.

We are currently 45% funded, which is surpassing my goal of raising $10,000 in the first week, and I'm so excited to get over the 50% hump. I'm glad that people are not on their computers and phones as much on the weekend - my kind of people. I'm hoping to go into this coming week with momentum, and will humbly ask again that if you are able and willing to share with your community, that that is so appreciated and helps move this train forward.</p><p>Secondly, yesterday morning I came down off the mountain and rode my bike to the flea market, and am excited to tell you that I was able to gather a couple more pieces that I've just added to the Kickstarter rewards. There are three more knives and two more textiles now available. I have had to offer them at a slightly increased price, because I realized that my excitement for sharing these pieces with you overrode any business sense about making sure I wasn't losing money in the exchange and shipping. The knives and textiles are beautiful - full of life, use, and texture - and I will be sharing them over instagram in the next days. I am letting you know here first, and I will announce it mid-morning Eastern Standard Time. </p><p>That's all for now, and thank you !</p><p>All my best,</p><p>Simone</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1541222842,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIzMzM5Nzk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Project Update # 1 !","publishedAt":1541222842,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Simone Bodmer-Turner","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/925/582/12af99888ca126ffe3b22cdaef32aa2d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1539765933&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1ddc1412fd5c2e8d68742b4bd8559bf8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Hello everyone ! </p><p>Afternoon time here in Japan after my second shift firing the anagama kiln overnight.

You can help me maintain this momentum !

There are many pieces of her sculptural handbuilt vessels available as rewards, as well as hands-on workshops and pieces she's found and made during her residency in the Japanese countryside. </i></li></ul><p>A couple things I wanted to be sure to address that have come up from pledgers:</p><p><b>1. Pledging for two rewards. </b>(Wow, thank you !)If you'd like to pledge for two rewards, there are two work arounds, as Kickstarter only allows you to select one. </p><ul><li>\nFirst option : shoot me a note through Kickstarter that you'd also like to pledge for another reward, then increase your pledge of the initial reward to cover both (and the shipping for both, please please). I will add you to my spreadsheet of double pledgers and make sure you receive both of the rewards that you would like to. If one the rewards you've selected is highly limited - i.e. pieces found in Japan, private handbuilding classes, the higher pledge pieces from my permanent collection of vessels or a custom piece - be sure to select that reward and up it to cover another selection that is more flexible quantity wise. </li></ul><ul><li>\nSecond option : You can make another Kickstarter account with a separate email address, and pledge from that account. </li></ul><p><b>2. Expanding the items available from the Japanese flea market. </b>I will do my best to add more unique pieces that I find at the flea market here. The knives and textiles were the first pledges to disappear, and I love knowing that so many of you are as excited about these funky, old, beautiful functional objects and tools as I am. However, any margin on these pieces are very small, so I may have to up the price a bit on the pledges if I am able to find more that I really like. I will bike to the market tomorrow morning, and be in touch with my finds !</p><p><b>4. Salt Dish + Spoon set additions. </b>I have just upped the amount of Salt Dish + Spoon sets available since this has been such a popular and accessible reward (and because I'm the kind of person who carries little tins of salt with me everywhere I go). If you had wanted to pledge for that, but they were all sold out at the time, there are now more available.</p><p>Thank you so much for your support thus far, please be in touch if you have any questions about altering or increasing your pledge !</p><p>All my best from Japan,</p><p>Simone</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1540978928,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"25000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"36087.5","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":235,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
