In order to promote the art form that I love so much, I've contacted one of my favourite illustrators, Kendyl Lauzon (a.k.a Breakfast Jones) to help me make a calendar for next year. She has already created the first of twelve images, 'The Decorator', which I've used above!&nbsp;</p><p>The obvious question is: why celebrate ceramics by having a campaign involving illustrations&nbsp;rather than my own artwork or some by other Australian clay artists?&nbsp;</p><p>Simply, it comes down to shipping costs.&nbsp;</p><p>The high cost of shipping fragile, heavy items around Australia and the rest fo the world would make for a very expensive campaign indeed. I want ceramic art fans looking to be involved in a fun project to undeterred by high shipping costs.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">The Illustrations</span></p><p>In order to capture all the skills that ceramicists can demonstrate, we will be bringing you illustrations of a dozen artists at work in their studios. Each will show a skill utilised in the creation of ceramic art. &nbsp;For added flavour, the style will be quintessential 1950s goodness.&nbsp;</p><p>Every month will show a new fun, hopefully inspiring illustration. A charming gift for art loving or art making friends. I have tried to capture as wide a range of skills and activities&nbsp;as possible in order to show the diversity in the art form.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">The Skills</span></p><p>In addition to the already created image of an artist decorating we will be adding:</p><p>Clay harvesting, Handbuilding, Throwing, Turning, Slip Casting, Sculpting, Texturing, Carving, Firing, Glazing Making and Firing.</p><p>Each image will be a newly created, original illustration from Kendyl, that we hope will be a celebration of ceramic art.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Style Inspiration&nbsp;</span></p><p>Below is a vintage illustration from the 1950s that hopefully gives you an idea about the style of illustrations. They will be clear, simple, colourful and of course reflect everything involved in making ceramic art.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Style\" data-caption=\"Style\" data-id=\"13117803\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Style\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/117/803/a98782a912b168ef32994146afd18891_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1469017064&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=901a80ac5d00f85d72cce43fb971031b\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Style</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">The Calendar Specifications</span></p><p>The calendar will be A4 in size, full colour, saddle-stitched on the long side, printed double sided, cover on 250gsm gloss artboard, internals printed double sided on 150gsm gloss art paper.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"13128186\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/128/186/3f6aad5ad66f5074d43a8610f1be6f65_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1469094948&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=958ebaf069ceaff6c25e116f1bf3c8be\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"13128188\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/128/188/ba6b5d600f7e47c546f41f0f6b8f3fed_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1469094975&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=996bdfae099945d186f70dd0c3a1f712\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Timeline 2016</span></p><p>August - Kickstarter launch&nbsp;</p><p>September to October - Illustrations are created</p><p>November - Production of calendar and prints</p><p>Early December - Packing and shipping to backers</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Shipping and packing </span></p><p>We can ship worldwide.

Our wonderful illustrator Kendyl will be undertaking other work as well. Juggling multiple projects may be a challenging but is offset by allowing so much time (Aug to Oct inclusive). \r\n\r\nRisks\r\nPrinting: We are using a national professional commercial printing service who are set up to do runs of up to 400 calendars as an everyday thing. But, on the off-chance that the success of the project requires more printing than can be achieved by them, there is a second Print company we can use. They have a very similar calendar they can print.\r\n\r\nMailing: Getting all rewards delivered before Christmas is our goal and we will have three weeks to get them out based on a print/received target date of Dec 1st. This will easily allow us enough time to send rewards for Australian supporters but for those in other countries even airmail may cause delays. So, all overseas rewards will be mailed first followed by domestic.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on
