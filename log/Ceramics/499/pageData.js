People from all ages, genders, and various demographics will be able to come into our studio, learn various PYOP techniques from our educated and well trained staff, interact with other local PYOP enthusiasts, enjoy wine/beer in our adults only area while they create their own unique works of art, and otherwise have the opportunity to craft a memorable and unique experience each time they visit. In today’s PYOP world, most studios maintain a low cost operational model which means little to no training and education of staff, limited services offered, and limited space. At Paint Some Pots, our staff will undergo continuous education and training on the various techniques involved with pottery painting (stencils, stamps, puffy paint, double glazes, bubble methods, etc) so that our customers are continuously learning and expanding their own knowledge about PYOP, making it a far more educational and beneficial experience every time they visit. Because of limited space constraints, most traditional studios also have just 1 main studio floor which doesn’t allow for any 21+ areas where adults can get away from birthday parties and other large groups of small children, and enjoy their space and more intimate surroundings while painting their pottery, perhaps over a cold beer or glass of wine.

Some of these items might require more time to obtain, perhaps licenses and permits as well, but the main obstacles really stem from the processes and requirements of state and local agencies and could thus push beyond the stated completion date.  All processes will be communicated real time so that all backers are up to speed as individual milestones are completed and updates on others are obtained.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":3,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSilver Donor\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>During construction and interior design, contributors names will be permanently written onto main wall as a Silver Level Donor.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-03-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Mar 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nGold Donor\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>During construction and interior design, contributors names will be permanently written onto main wall as a Gold Level Donor.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-03-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Mar 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nPlatinum Donor\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>During construction and interior design, contributors names will be permanently written onto main wall as a Platinum Level Donor.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-03-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Mar 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>"],"number_of_FAQ":"0","number_of_updates":"0","number_of_comments_depth_all":"0","contents_of_FAQ":[],"last_updated":"August 19, 2016"}
