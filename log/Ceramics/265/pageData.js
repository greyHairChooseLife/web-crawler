A 10x10 ft. mural made with 340 6x6 inch ceramic tiles will be used to create a ceramic mosaic about Detroit and community. A marbling technique will be applied to convey colors that reflect emotions tied to the individuals and city of Detroit. \n</p><p>&nbsp;\n The idea is to bring life to the community through a project that doesn’t affect one part of the city, but the city as a whole. By bringing different areas together with cultural and societal differences, an integrated idea will shine on the concept of unity found in diversity. \n \n&nbsp;</p><p>I plan and have already started to work with a combination of schools, children and homeless centers, a geriatric center, a women's facility, and other locals from Detroit to complete the “Together We Rise” Mural. This project is not to evoke a question that needs to be answered from the viewer’s perspective, but to be seen as a project that solidifies the truth that is Detroit: a community worth fighting and standing together for. \n</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have already started this mural project and have collected some of the materials but am having a hard time gathering the rest of the materials needed to finish on time. I applied for a grant through the Awesome Foundation and was one of the six finalist picked out of all of Detroit! Unfortunately I was the third runner up and only the first and second place holders received grants. \r\n\r\nIt was a great experience and gave me great confidence in knowing this idea is something worth pursuing to the end. This is why I am starting up a kickstarter to help me reach out into the community to raise my goal and give back to my second home, Detroit.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0yMDkwNzI2ODc1","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":0,"number_of_comments_depth_all":0,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\n\"Together We Rise\" is a diverse group-based project that uses colors and ceramics to reflect emotions tied to the city of Detroit.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/324/019/f186853d844e4c05e1b9c546f8e8a34f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463755683&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=af5477fb07a5d11c5f10b724a3f4b6af","last_updated":"January 10, 2016","project_name":"Together We Rise\": A Detroit Community Mural Projec","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"650","amount_of_pledged":"675","number_of_backers":"8","rate_of_funded":103,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Detroit, MI","creator_name":"Brittany Kihl","creator_location":"Detroit, MI","creator_description":"I am a senior at Marygrove College studying Fine Arts with a minor in Psychology and Art Therapy.
