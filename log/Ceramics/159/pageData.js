All donations will go directly towards the following: industrial shelving, new glazes and other raw materials, small test kiln, larger kiln installation and vent system, and a dust air filter. These necessary changes will help me speed up production so that I can make more pieces, attend more events, and continue to the business so that I can eventually provide art lessons or workshops to people in my community!&nbsp;With your help I can finally move into a studio and hopefully empower others to pursue their creative dreams!</p>\n<br>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Background Story:</span></p>\n<p>I am a ceramics artist based in Worcester, MA. I grew up with a dad who's an artist, and have been playing around with clay for as long as I can remember. Two years ago, I found out I had a one-in-a-million bone tumor in my leg and would need an immediate knee replacement. The recovery process was long and painful, but during that time I re-learned how to throw on the wheel, and my passion for ceramics was born!</p>\n<br>\n<p>I started selling pieces to family and friends, and have now expanded to the point where I am selling at craft events and creating custom pieces for local businesses. My small business is expanding rapidly (which I am so grateful for) but I need some funds to help me build a real pottery studio. I am currently making all my pottery in my shared apartment living room, hauling it 100 miles to be fired, and storing hundreds of pounds of clay and glaze in my car. The space and storage constraints prevent me from making more pieces, and lack of an accessible kiln makes production very slow and tricky.&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Future Goals:</span></p>\n<p>I worked in the public school system for several years and have a passion for teaching, and my ultimate dream is to be able to teach people in my community how to make art. I have been in contact with various community organizations who have expressed a serious need for more arts programs in the city, but I am currently spending all my time and resources on start-up costs of the business. With your help I can create a studio, install necessary equipment, and streamline my process so that I can be a more efficient and profitable business, and ultimately be able provide art lessons to youth in the community.</p>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Current &quot;Studio&quot; Space\" data-id=\"35153843\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/035/153/843/e69f6ed04e5e3e82f725ee82ac362f6e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1633639067&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=89dbd3d8b1d7f84e0d8e19b248878108\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Current \"Studio\" Space</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"The joys of storing chemicals in your car \" data-id=\"35215437\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/035/215/437/2b7d42a74d6f6342aebd52dcd3ed8aac_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1634134305&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=bb1c173ea08e0e3de5851a8fc144a0d4\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The joys of storing chemicals in your car </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"35215447\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/035/215/447/eced42b9f5c860cd69fba2bc64a46e4b_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1634134343&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=e1bee1664aa09c1aec06e5ba331df0fa\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"35215451\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/035/215/451/b2284ba8469a539b25e6a4b90da02919_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1634134359&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=30a0799fbe3a69ff2a8df406c0d98d8c\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"35215456\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/035/215/456/4c3ef6ded679e592f8fd8c82e8479124_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1634134375&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=3ae01e65cc224ed14a86b58c37bd538b\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">My biggest challenge so far has been my lack of studio space.
