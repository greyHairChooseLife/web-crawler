About a year ago I was out for dinner with my family and the restaurant gave us a worry stone with the check. I took it home and found myself rubbing it at random times and it felt good.  At the time I didn't even know what a worry stone was but what I did know was that rubbing that stone helped me to focus better on what I was doing and at other times it helped to relieve stress. Worry stones are such simple things, but sometimes the simplest things can have the greatest utility.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4141191\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/141/191/69292fde8f7357a7088317876493ffdc_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436808043&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5315f8a53028d1cb04eaa628c550c09b\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Worry stones have been around forever. I did a bit of research and found that worry stones date back to the ancient Greeks and perhaps even further. I think they’ve been used for so long because they work. They’re an all-natural way to <span class=\"bold\">improve focus</span>, <span class=\"bold\">reduce stress</span>, <span class=\"bold\">calm the nerves</span> and <span class=\"bold\">clear the head</span>. \nOver time I realized that when I was rubbing on the worry stone I was also <span class=\"bold\">unplugging from my digital devices</span>.  I was thinking or zoning out but I wasn’t on my smartphone or my tablet or my laptop.  Increasingly, I think it’s important for people, especially people my age, to unplug and just think about something or maybe better yet, think about absolutely nothing at all.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4130922\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/130/922/eabd21ed3cfaf78377070135f0b42230_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436590201&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c1e2a4483034eb69c32a8191a63dd8d9\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>It occurred to me that if a worry stone could help me, it could probably help a lot of other people as well. I’ve always been interested in entrepreneurship and I love a challenge so I thought, why not start a business that can not only teach me about entrepreneurship, but also produce a product that can actually help people.  And that was the idea behind SoulStones.\nI set out not just to replicate a machine-made worry stone like the one I got at the restaurant, but to <span class=\"bold\">make it better</span>.&nbsp;</p><p>I started this journey over ten months ago and at the outset I knew absolutely nothing about ceramics. So I had to find somebody to teach me. Lucky for me it turns out that there is a nationally recognized non-profit art center in the next town called the <span class=\"bold\">Clay Art Center</span> and they offer ceramic lessons.  I signed up with Matt Smith, one of the artists-in-residence, and he has literally taught me everything I know about ceramics.&nbsp;Over many months we experimented with different materials, form factors, techniques, textures and glazes. Through many trials and errors we finally arrived at what I think is the perfect worry stone…..the <span class=\"bold\">SoulStone</span>.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4144647\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/144/647/4d19b238658e82ed3e625e8d8c88d5a9_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436844181&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d26b2012861e0a4dacc8b25f5d795875\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4140090\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/140/090/f688b604458a60fca150e139ce0b83bd_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436797693&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=78ba51fa1776590a5b35a7399b5d7838\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I handcraft every SoulStone so no two will ever be alike. Each will have it’s own personal character. I think of each one as an <span class=\"bold\">individual piece of art</span>, made with passion and care. Here’s how I make them. First, I shape the stone out of moist porcelain clay. I try to shape each piece to fit comfortably in someone’s hand. Each stone is then stamped with a maker’s mark to brand it a SoulStone.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4137927\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/137/927/307d7aadb9c9b224ee75caaf855656ff_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436753373&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9088fbd568d9c24267b4a00ce216bf50\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Then it’s off to the kiln where the stones will be fired at 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit for about eight hours. After this firing the stones are what we call bisque porcelain. Once the stones have cooled we give them a light sanding and then they’re ready to be glazed. Each stone gets a coating of lead-free glaze which is applied by hand. At this stage it's important to make sure that no glaze is on the bottom of the stone or it will stick to the kiln when fired.</p>\n\n<p>Once the stones have dried they are fired once again for eight hours. After this firing, the stones have finally become SoulStones. A finished SoulStone is essentially <span class=\"bold\">a piece of porcelain covered in a layer of glass</span>. They’re beautiful to look at and feel awesome in the hand.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4140269\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/140/269/449b9b58b10f22dd570c37e7332c38af_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436799475&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8a78ade00a4f2d16416b60c434aa9985\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4143798\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/143/798/07b3c9c99b8c8512a8b716db7d965075_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436832326&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=169cb4e3620befebf2946ed23f4d963b\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>As I was thinking abut what colors to glaze the SoulStones, I came across some articles on the psychology of color. I don’t think color theory is rooted in science but I do think it adds another dimension to the experience of rubbing a SoulStone. Unplugging is great, but unplugging and consciously <span class=\"bold\">reflecting on a value or emotion</span> is even better. So I decided to select glazes that corresponded to a range of colors, each of which evokes a specific emotion:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4143782\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/143/782/e5fd2dec1ea0ba32f980881682f5edc0_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436832234&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8a3f9342b89097c7dc7af3e9f550ec57\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>So the idea is that while you're rubbing on the SoulStone you're thinking about the emotion that it's linked to. You're focused on positivity and change, and hopefully that energy <span class=\"bold\">makes a difference in your day</span>. Or, of course, you can just use the SoulStones for stress relief and that's great as well.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"4146443\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/146/443/8b36d586a1037a072e2fb0025be77e16_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436878623&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1cf69ce20762a199cd76b5174861c887\" data-airgap-id=\"33\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Through this journey I’ve learned a tremendous amount about what it takes to start a business. My education started with product development but eventually included sourcing, costing, manufacturing, packaging, distribution and marketing. I don’t want SoulStones to just be a project, I want it to be a business that I can grow. To do that <span class=\"bold\">I need your help and support</span>. I want to raise $5,000 to fulfill all of the rewards and to launch an e-commerce website to build the business. Oh, and I also need to pay my parents back for lending me money to purchase all of the raw materials and packaging that I've bought to date.
