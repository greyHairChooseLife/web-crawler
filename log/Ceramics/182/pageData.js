I first became interested in clay back in the mid 1990s, although I did not always have access to clay or kilns. Over the last 12 years or so, I've found my way back to my art—you might remember me from the Prayer Pendant Project back in 2013. Over the last two years or so I've taken some adult learning classes at <a href=\"https://www.eiu.edu/adulted/all.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EIU</a>, and met some wonderfully inspiring people. I've discovered I have a penchant for sprigs and stamps with which to decorate the clay, and that I have a proclivity for hand building rather than throwing. As the days progressed I started making mosaics and other tile-decorated items. They tell such an interesting story—and I do love a good story, don't you?</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"First Glazed Tiles. \" data-id=\"31892742\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/892/742/c8cb8dfce91a94443588c15a6624742e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1609615152&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8abb5582332b728948c2969b22f5d2e5\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">First Glazed Tiles. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The clay itself also tells a story. Without the five elements, there would be no clay art. The clay body is formed of the earth, but it takes water to make it malleable, air to dry it so it does not explode in the kiln, the fire of the kiln to change it from mud to stoneware, and my spirit to shape it for its final form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Greenware Drying; Dragonfly Mug and Moon Incense Pot.\" data-id=\"31892973\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/892/973/4b7cd08920c6db8fe906557c8d525505_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1609617514&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1dcfe9e8c845ce58b64bbe5b5e87b373\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Greenware Drying; Dragonfly Mug and Moon Incense Pot.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>There's a definite journey to every tile—every piece of my pottery, for that matter. It starts out as a lump of clay. I put it through the slab roller, or sometimes just roll it out with the rolling pin, to the required depth. It then has to be compressed and smoothed; I use a rubber rib and a very Zen motion to get the rolled slab of clay just so. It then has to dry out just a touch, so that it will take the image of the tiles without sticking to them. Once I have cut out the tiles, they are dried slowly, between two pieces of drywall, so that the chance for them to warp is minimized. When they are leather hard I check them to see if any of them need smoothing around the edges, and then they go back to the boards until they are completely dry. Then I check every tile as it goes into the kiln and file down any rough areas I missed with a nail buffer. They are first bisque fired, and when they are cool I paint them with diluted underglaze. This all has to be wiped back, though; it sticks to the cracks but not to the raised area of the tile, and that is what I think makes the texture pop. Next the tiles are coated with a clear or translucent glaze, every tile hand painted at least twice, before going in the kiln for their final firing. As I load them, they each get their bottoms washed; no one wants their bottom sticking to a kiln shelf! So you see, it's all very time consuming, labor intensive, and wonderfully meditative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Sacred Spiral Pendant, Made with the Energy of December's Eclipses.\" data-id=\"31892897\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/892/897/d09aadf65e07003d11b530d6ab5e116b_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1609616805&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=49ea5242a4bcf6e4296c4ffc79d042c1\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Sacred Spiral Pendant, Made with the Energy of December's Eclipses.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>To be honest, I've gone all around the houses with my art—and those who know me will readily agree! Back when I first started I made simple slab and coil forms. Then I migrated to the wheel, and to all kinds of glazing and firing techniques. However, a trip of a lifetime took me on a rather unexpected journey back to my roots.&nbsp;</p>\n<br>\n<p>In 2019 a childhood friend and I made our way to England to walk <a href=\"https://hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hadrian's Wall</a>. Now, England and its gothic art and medieval decoration is no stranger to me. My mum was a war bride, and I lived over there for a significant part of my adulthood. My daughter was born over there and my husband is a Lancashire lad. However, this most recent trip reawakened me to the Celtic designs and mythology that had captivated me from my years as a young bride, when I went bellringing across throughout the English Midlands, immersing myself in the old traditions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Celtic Tree Tile.\" data-id=\"31893009\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/893/009/4c2c371f6b97d6b4956b6a9a1871a9b2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1609617949&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6b34d8bc74c5573a75c1fb8da3184bfc\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Celtic Tree Tile.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Since returning to the US from that wonderful walk, I have noticed that my art is taking on a Celtic and somewhat mystical slant. I'm no stranger to mysticism, either; I'm a practicing Druid, I've worked as a ghostwriter for television psychic personas, and I've been a regular contributor to the <a href=\"https://www.llewellyn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Llewellyn Worldwide</a> annuals for several years. I started studying astrology in the 1970s, and—typical of me—I had to go all around the houses, exploring runes, tarot, palmistry, ogham, flower sentience, and other forms of divination before coming to the realization that it doesn't matter what you use as long as it speaks to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Random glazed tiles... aren't they fun?\" data-id=\"32006846\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/006/846/888c6287c3197f8406ace68ce4318ea8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1610579810&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ea4125aff05cbda7ee76422de295b542\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Random glazed tiles... aren't they fun?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Fire the Tiles is well underway, but I want to explore more options. I feel I've settled into a nice rhythm, making my own incense pots and blending my own incenses to go with them and the story their designs impart, and I want to go deeper. The patterns I currently use for the oracle and on my pots and mugs are those I have collected over the years from yard sales, ceramic retailers, and pottery tool makers. I long to take it a step further and design my own sprigs and stamps, rather than using what is 'off the peg.' This is where you come in, for custom 3D printing is not cheap, and I do not feel that I am talented enough to just wing it freehand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"These greenware tiles are the very first prototypes of the Fire the Tiles Oracle.

I will always keep you abreast of any delays, so that you know when you might expect your rewards to arrive.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xNzU5Mzg5NTQy","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":14,"number_of_comments_depth_all":16,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nI'm making eclectic and original handmade ceramic tiles for decoration, divination, or mixed media art.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/872/063/34d3b280dc0458287b4725077a349616_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1609363550&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=2bbaf009cda7f44ff6fdec0bb9c31542","last_updated":"June 5, 2021","project_name":"ire the Tiles","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"300","amount_of_pledged":"961","number_of_backers":"37","rate_of_funded":320,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Westfield, IL","creator_name":"Charlie Rainbow Wolf","creator_location":"Charleston, IL","creator_description":"HI!

I simply have to keep my hands busy! \r\n\r\nAs well as pottery, I also enjoy exploring the mystic arts, working with herbs and incenses, learning about history, knitting, writing (I'm in some Llewellyn annuals, among other places), music, and cooking. I'm a recorded singer-songwriter and a published author. I live in Midwestern USA with my very patient husband and special needs Great Danes.
