First there was the arctic weather that slowed everything down. Then—because of said weather—I had to scrap some pieces and start over (I only have a propane heater in the Artbox...).</p>\n<br>\n<p>When I got over that hurdle, then there was the technology. I couldn't for the life of me work out how to use the backer report (which may sound silly to most of you, but machinery—including computers and smartphones and the like—and I have a long and checkered past). When I finally did get it downloaded, even though it wasn't what I hoped it would be, the printer ran out of ink *insert epic face palm*. </p>\n<br>\n<p>Finally what I did was grab an old notebook and hand write everyone's name, address, and what they backed on a separate page. I then used this as a reference to hand write the address labels on the envelopes, and marked in the notebook when I sent the tiles. I probably added many unnecessary steps to what I'm sure to others is a simple and straightforward process, but whatever. I (finally) got there!</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>The tiles are in the post!</strong> </p>\n<br>\n<p>I've learned so much through this process. I've learned that postage rates have changed <em>a</em> <em>lot</em> since I last did any bulk mailing. I've learned that I cannot control the weather, and that what takes 3 days to do in the heat of the summer can take 3 weeks to do in the cold damp of winter. Most of all, though, I've learned that people are usually kind, and for this, I am extremely grateful. </p>\n<br>\n<p>I'll pop on here again and let you know when the pendants and oracles and other bits and bobs have posted, and of course, I'll share my next works in progress with you.
