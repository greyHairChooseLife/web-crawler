I am still working on the last batches of the planters for those of you who have not received yours yet. When putting groupings of them together some fit better as one grouping than others, so if you haven’t received it yet and you were at the top of the backers list that is why. I know we are well past the expected delivery date. I apologize for the wait to those of you have not received your planters yet. Unfortunately, I was set back on orders due to the pandemic. My wheel died around mid March so I had to scramble to find a new one because there were no stores open to fix the broken wheel. Then my ceramic supply store closed within a days notice and all shipments were on back order for glazing materials and clay so that was another thing that kept me from working as quickly as I would have liked. Luckily, things are open again here in Ohio and I am on a roll again and working to get your planters out as quickly as possible! Thank you so much for your continued patience during all of this time. I hope you are doing well and staying safe and healthy. I will be sending out tracking info when your pieces are shipped so watch for a message from me in the next couple of weeks!</p>\n\n<p>Christa</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1587600984,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI4MTgxNjM=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Hello Again!","publishedAt":1587600984,"pinnedAt":null,"number":4,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Christa Morris","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/023/843/377/ef224f63677b57cea668a5f2914feb26_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1579474576&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=e1d9137420e433b27ba2995c44380d2c","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":6,"commentsCount":4,"body":"<p>If you are on the top of the backers list, expect your planters to be coming very soon!
