If it starts looking like that will be a problem, we will cap the existing pottery rewards and create new reward tiers of the same items but with a later delivery date.\r\n\r\nThe delivery date of November 2016 for all rewards that include pottery lessons is when we will contact backers and start scheduling classes. Depending on availability and demand, your class may be scheduled in a later month.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xNzI2ODY1NDk2","number_of_FAQ":2,"number_of_updates":15,"number_of_comments_depth_all":1,"contents_of_FAQ":["<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_183401\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"183401\" href=\"#project_faq_183401\" name=\"project_faq_183401\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nIf I pick my pottery item up instead of shipping it, do I still pay for shipping?\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>No, you will still have to pay for the shipping part when you donate because there is currently no way to offer a free pickup option through Kickstarter.
