We have spent hours looking at each of our pieces, finding a connection with it, finding a meaning that is our own - a very personal place for the object. Now we want to share this beauty and this finding with the world.</p><p>It has taken us long hours at the sketchbook and many years before we could develop the right materials and the right methods to create this art form. Even then, every piece takes numerous days to be made, engaging the artist for so long and so intensely that to hold a piece in your hand is to hold a part of the artist who has made it.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">THE PROCESS:</span></p><p>Every piece is carefully done with attention to details and number of cracks. Every piece breaks differently and is different from any other, making one more connection to its human symbolism - no two of us are alike, and neither are or sufferings and our stories of overcoming them.</p><p>It is a long and demanding process to make these lamps, each stage of the making, breaking and repairing requiring extreme care and time.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"5253746\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/253/746/2b6669bb683fcb4f961a86760c2b6c34_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1453835382&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=71cb90d5c81cf8b1401ff44496866952\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"5253747\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/253/747/50c8dc561bf8ca3bdc9d46597e6c2c47_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1453835420&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b9b5efb9d1c4dfe2547a93cd4c2a87a6\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>In this Kickstarter, We are offering some basic models of our work as rewards and hope to generate enough presence to set up a fully functioning business, and a studio to create more of this work.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"14209148\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/209/148/46621e9000cb40d2f6e66a6f3fabb108_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1477072641&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=41aaa9b3c677b3756beb0a540cd02358\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">THE REWARDS</span></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"14209060\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/209/060/dc7fb51784c727ab31ad4fd2e5a09c90_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1477072091&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f972028bcf9b82dbb22406d2d00131e0\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Reward 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"USD $45 (CAD $60) -The Little Cup.\" data-caption=\"USD $45 (CAD $60) -The Little Cup.\" data-id=\"14209279\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"USD $45 (CAD $60) -The Little Cup.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/209/279/c16104eedf7361c157428eb31a0f3747_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1477073219&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b44cdddb5a254d240e06cf50efda658c\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">USD $45 (CAD $60) -The Little Cup.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Reward 2&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"USD $45 (CAD $60) -
