For the most part forest gnomes would simply like to be ignored as they have been for millennia</span>.<span class=\"bold\"> However, if you have the good fortune to befriend a Forest Gnome they will be a true and loyal friend for life. Forest gnomes' lives are generally comfortable and idyllic. Forest gnomes are largely hunter-gatherers, harvesting their food from wild fruits, nuts, and berries, and supplementing their diet with a little meat from their hunting.</span> <span class=\"bold\">&nbsp;Forest gnome villages are usually composed of less than a hundred members, who are often all a part of an extended family. Forest gnome homes are generally small, reclusive, and so well-hidden that a human might well walk within a few feet of a gnome home and not even realize it. Part of this is because of the unique manner in which forest gnomes construct their homes, which are typically located within trees.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Forest gnome society, like that of most hunter-gatherers, is a curious mix of luxury and hard work. Forest gnomes spend most of their days working for the benefit of the community but after returning home from a days</span> <span class=\"bold\">work they are usually treated to a relaxed lifestyle with few causes of stress. During such times, forest gnomes devote themselves to a variety of humble but impressive artistic practices.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">The Forest Gnomes highlighted in this kickstarter will come from 3 basic groups; the Elder Forest Gnome, who is renowned for his wisdom and knowledge; the hardworking head of household Forest Gnome, who takes care of his family and the not so productive devil may care impish Forest Gnome. &nbsp;You may choose one or more of these charmers to add a special touch to your home.</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"An Elder Forest Gnome in the making.

Each piece is unique, no two are exactly alike. When I make something I like to think about the person I am making the piece for. &nbsp;It gives me a warm, wonderful feeling to know that something I have made with my own two hands will be used by others in their everyday lives. &nbsp;There is such a unique connection between the potter and the person who utilizes the pottery. &nbsp;&nbsp;Each piece connects the maker to the user. Each time you use your hand made pottery in your own home, you are interacting with the sincerity and soul of the artisan who created it.</span></span></p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">As always working with clay, and especially Porcelain, is fraught with things that can go wrong. Pieces that are drying don't dry as fast as they should. Or they dry too fast and leave cracks. Each step of the journey has its own unique challenges. Sometimes you get exactly what you wanted and sometimes you don't even come close. Opening a glaze kiln load is like opening presents on Xmas. You never know what you get until you get it. There are also things that can happen during shipping, even after you make that perfect piece and send it off to your backer. The last thing you want to hear is how that special piece arrived in pieces. It is heartbreaking for both you and your backer. I have made it a practice to remake any pieces that are damaged in shipping.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMjQyMTExMTIy","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":9,"number_of_comments_depth_all":5,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nMay I introduce the Forest Gnomes\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/920/323/c6e7bdb78ec4081e7b7783865711a25f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1649379954&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=28c9a669f41134ff8f722b5bf6ad1d06","last_updated":"October 3, 2022","project_name":"rom My Hands To Yours 6th Edition","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"350","amount_of_pledged":"691","number_of_backers":"10","rate_of_funded":197,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Buda, TX","creator_name":"Charlotte Wheat","creator_location":"Buda, TX","creator_description":"I am a 78 year old widowed potter with a BFA in Studio Arts from Texas A&M University-commerce.
