Many of them are over the age of five and are in foster care for at least two years before finding their Forever Family.&nbsp;These children go unseen and unheard by mainstream America. Their stories are diverse, complicated and heartbreaking and these kids are AMAZING!  Smart, funny, insightful, full of compassion and loving hearts, Finding Forever aims to show you their bright, shining, beautiful faces this November in Western Massachusetts.&nbsp;</p><p>This is who we are talking about…<a href=\"http://mareinc.org/photolisting/4287-4288-Aleeanna-Savannah.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://mareinc.org/photolisting/4287-4288-Aleeanna-Savannah.html</a></p><p>Every potter invariably has a cup or mug that just hasn’t sold.  Much like these kids, its unique qualities have not been given their due.  Potters across the nation have been invited to contribute such a cup to this exhibition to represent a child in the foster care system. Also included will be professional photographs and information about some of the children in foster care.\nA portion of the proceeds from each cup sale benefit the Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange (M.A.R.E.). &nbsp;There is more about M.A.R.E. on our <a href=\"http://findingforeverexhibition.org/about-m-a-r-e-2/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;I am forever grateful to M.A.R.E. for their role in finding my children.  Yes, I have two amazing kids who were in the Massachusetts foster care system.  Adopting them has been one of the most meaningful and fulfilling events of my life. I have sought a way to give attention to their work and these kids for some time.  I am excited to be working with them now to fulfill that mission.</p><p>I want other kids to find their Forever Families, too. That is why this event is so important. Doesn't every child deserve that kind of love, unending support and joy in their life?&nbsp;</p><p>The support has been incredible, but we're just not there yet financially. &nbsp;We now have a landlord willing to rent us short term exhibition space at a reduced rate in the heart of our city, Greenfield, Massachusetts, because he believes in what we are doing. We have potters sending in their cups, telling their colleagues and sharing their stories with us. You can see some of them <a href=\"http://findingforeverexhibition.org/the-cups/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. We have volunteers offering their time to do anything necessary to make this happen.&nbsp;You can help, too, by contributing to this Kickstarter to finance the rent, utilities, building and exhibition costs. &nbsp;Help us make it happen!&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">We risk not having enough money to get the doors open.

The cups will be displayed and ready for purchase at the opening November 7th and throughout the rest of the year. All work will be priced at $50 each.
