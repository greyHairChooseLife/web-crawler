I am a functional ceramic artist looking to further develop my throwing skills and have my work selected for gallery shows and exhibitions. I am striving to get my work into the hands of as many people as I can!\n</p><p>I discovered my passion for ceramics in middle school and continued my love and education of clay through high school, leading me to pursue this passion into higher education. \nI graduated from the University of Kansas in 2015 with my BFA. Since then I have had the opportunity to teach in a local ceramics studio and work as the ceramics studio intern at the local community arts center, the Lawrence Arts Center. \n</p><p>This time outside of academia has given me the freedom to explore the world of the living artist and has guided me down many paths. As I continue to dedicate myself to turning my passion for ceramics into a sustainable career, I am constantly looking for ways to take advantage of the opportunities around me. This has lead to my decision to go back to the University of Kansas for a Post Bac study to reap the benefits of an ever-changing studio environment with new faces and new ideas to help guide me as I continue to branch out into the world.\n\n</p><p>What is a post Bac? Post Bac is a non-degree seeking program for those who have completed a bachelors program. It will allow me the time to go deeper into&nbsp; my studies of the field of ceramics and surround myself with like minded individuals!!\n\n&nbsp;</p><p>The benefits of a post bac study will allow me the time to spend as much time in the studio as possible in an intensive environment. It will provide me with a larger studio space than what I currently have which will in turn allow me to create a large body of work and continue to experiment and to improve my forms.  I will have the support from faculty helping me to apply to gallery shows and juried exhibitions with the hopes of getting my work out into the world.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\nKickstarter is ALL OR NOTHING so please help me reach my goal and take another step closer to making my dream into a reality! Your help is greatly appreciated!!</p><p>Fees:&nbsp;</p><p>•\tKick starter fee: 5% = $55 &amp; Processing fee: 3-5% = $55 (at 5%) </p><p>•\tUniversity Application fee: $30</p><p>\n•\tTuition fee: per semester $360 (2 semesters) = $720</p><p>\n•\tCall for Entry Fees/Shipping fees: Call for entry usually has a fee of around $30 per entry. I plan to apply to a minimum of at least one show per month plus the cost of shipping each piece both ways will vary --\n</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Risks: I am ready to work incredibly hard to complete the pieces and have them mailed out as quickly as I can!
