I am 20 years old, and from Ft.Lauderdale, FL.</p><p>I have always had an incredible passion for art in all forms. I have been practicing my talents and trying to expand and master my creativity since the young age of 4, when my mother started me in art classes after school.&nbsp;</p><p>I still remember the parent-teacher conference that really sparked my love for art. I was in pre-kindergarten 4, and had drawn a picture of myself for a school assignment. I remember my teacher, Mrs.Clark, taking the picture out and telling my mom how good of an artist I was at such a young age.</p><p>I really tried to color in the lines! Ahahah. That has to be one of my most fond childhood memories, most of my fond memories come from art classes or associations made through them. My parents saw how happy art made me and kept me in art classes for a couple more years until their divorce. During this time, I was in an art class at ABC near where my mom was working at the time. I drew a reef shark in class one night, and the teacher asked if I wanted to enter it into an art contest. I was ecstatic! A couple of months went by, and on one of my Father's weekends, I remember him getting a call from my mom. She was at the mall with my Grandmother, and they had children's pictures up from the contest hanging in the mall. I won the art contest, and my Grandmother almost fainted! I ended up winning a week at a day camp that spring break at Hugh Taylor Birch State Park. It was awesome, except for the bug bites XD&nbsp;</p><p>In High School I took art 2D/3D Honors my Junior year, and after I graduated I took a 3D art class at ASU in Tempe.&nbsp;</p><p>I have accumulated, and am still working on, a decent knowledge of ceramics and various crafts. I never want to stop learning, and coming up with new ideas and techniques to create and share my ideas and my passion with the world.</p><p>I plan to explore, learn, and grow with glass as another creative art medium, that I have had minimal time to practice as the materials are very expensive and I do not personally have them.</p><p>Your donations will help to bring my dreams to fruition, and open a door for me to experience an entire form of art and help mold the future of my lamp-working and ceramics career.</p><p>I am currently working with my boyfriend perfecting our execution of electro-forming various items, resin casting, and working with natural earth clay, as well as oven bake polymer clay.</p><p>My goal is $2600.&nbsp;</p><p>This will go towards: Studio rent, Kiln, Torch, Graphite tools, Glass rods, various types of clay/paints/glaze, and a Pottery wheel.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The setbacks that could possibly arise after my project is funded that I have in mind might be : \r\nI will have to save money to take more art classes, so that I can learn and master techniques more quickly and effectively.\r\n\r\nWe are facing some space issues at our house, and if we are going to stay here, or we have to move into an apartment, I will have to rent space at a studio. Hopefully this will not be too expensive, or we can move into a town house with a decent patio area.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A donation of $10.00 will get you a very cute, stylish, handmade cupcake, fruit, mushroom, crown or goldfish charm!
