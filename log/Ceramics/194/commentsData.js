Thanks for checking in on us! Yes, our city (Amarillo) has been a hot spot in Texas so we are a little slower in coming out of it all than other places. I do believe our numbers have been more down than up the last few days so we hope that's a trend that will stay! It has certainly caused delay for us in getting clay and glazes but we are finished with products now and are currently working on getting stuff ready to ship. Thank you for your concern and grace! Sarah :)","createdAt":1591373234,"author":{"id":"VXNlci00MDk5NTI4OTc=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/924/013/fad9af1898d33a09de02783166537cc8_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1580486219&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=8a3b6e3e89bca23fef917c9b469f72c6","name":"Two Mugs Studio","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/409952897"}},{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0yODYwMjk0MQ==","body":"I visited some friends in Amarillo many years ago (circa 1978-1980) and saw all the sites - the windmills AND the cows.  It was an unfair visit. They live in a manufactured home some 25 miles outside Amarillo on the windswept prairie. Spent almost all our time on \"the homestead\".
