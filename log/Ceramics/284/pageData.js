class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>hello world,\n</p><p>before we dig into the project, i would like to share a concept with you, it is that zero, nothingness, eternal darkness, does not exist, the number zero does not exist, death does not exist, there is no nothing, there is always something, there is always light,&nbsp;my name is Adam and welcome&nbsp;\n</p><p>now for the project, the thought for this first came to be when i was in school, on one hand you have&nbsp;perceived&nbsp;waste and those that are paying for their leftovers to be removed on one hand and those paying to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;compost or amended soil on the other, and this is not just occurring at the individual level but massively at the national with 1.3 billion tons of food is being thrown into landfills instead of back into the soil as compost as it should, there had to be a way to connect these together with a service that cannot just fix the problem at the micro level, but also at the macro, thus&nbsp;æggz(SM)\n</p><p>æggz(SM) is a streamlined and optimized compost creation service from neighborhood to city scale with no cost to the municipality, and conforms to all local, state, and national law, now there is nothing else out there like this, sure there are services that may do a portion of what has been described, those that gather, those that process, and those that sell soils, and while there are more finer details than just these 3 branches in our service, æggz(SM) is the only thing that encompasses the full spectrum of the process from start to finish (or start again for that matter) with superb quality at that\n</p><p>in addition to the service itself, there had to be a way to eliminate plastic containers and bags from the operation, and it could not just be some cheap bioplastic alternative, it had to be something that would stand up to the test of time, something that has been around as long as we have, and then it hit, earth, so two porcelain container æggs have been designed, one countertop ægg container for the kitchen and another larger ægg for collection, now these æggs are the crux of the design, each ægg whether large or medium will be handmade in america</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"medium volume = 1/10 cubic cubits        large volume = 1/3 cubic cubits\" data-caption=\"medium

7 colors of the rainbow</p><p>the collection ægg is only available in yellow for safety</p><p>key milestones &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul>\n<li>04.15.14 ~ approached idea of creating the ægg &nbsp;</li>\n<li>10.08.14 ~ started compost within prototype box &nbsp;</li>\n<li>04.04.15 ~ discovered a partner to create æggs&nbsp;</li>\n<li>09.28.15 ~ found yoke rice to provide with&nbsp;æggz(SM)</li>\n</ul><p>as a next step i wanted to work on growing food and matching nutrients to seed, but then it hit me how millions around the world are dying of thirst every day, so next we will find a way to draw the excess water out of the process with aims of potability, machine egg, but let us not get ahead of ourselves, because then&nbsp;</p><p>BAM! wouldn't you know it, turns out things have become a bit more complicated, i came across Genesis and can see signs, it is the end of time, now this is not the kind of news anyone wants to drop, and it is understood that the mood has changed a bit with that, and i know you may be freaking out a bit, but calm down, this is NOT the end of world, it is more the end of time as a concept, there is no ledge, and though there will be challenges along the way WE WILL MAKE IT,&nbsp;a period of prosperity and abundance will be first, but then will follow a worldwide drought and there will be a flood, THE BIG flood, but we need to take this one day at a time, we have a long road ahead but we will get through it to eden, i promise&nbsp;</p><p>now initially this was created to be a business but clearly has turned into much more, so instead of structuring the organization as a business or a non-profit, we will form a church for the umbrella organization, and not trying to save the worst news for last or anything, but if you were planning on having a baby any time soon, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you do not, these days will be difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Now it probably is not really on your mind, but there is more that needs to be shared surrounding the details of the service, however let us hold off on that for now, and over the next few days we will go over aspects of quality, cost, and work among other things&nbsp;</p><p>though I cannot give everything away, after 7 years the platform, equipment, and tools that are created will be given away, all of this from&nbsp;æ to z has been&nbsp;developed by myself and with that i have incurred the costs of development, so there are no investors who own a piece of this or influences from wall street or corporate america, there will not be any conflicting interests, now maybe this is new to you or maybe you had a head start which ever it may be it is hoped that you will find a way to contribute to this</p><p>now in the beginning i mentioned that there is no zero, however there is one place where the zeros actually do make a difference and that is when they are tagged onto the tail end your contribution, so please, be generous and add on those zeros, it might just save your life.</p><p>here are some drawings showing the evolution of shape&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\"
