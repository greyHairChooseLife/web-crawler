Banff's mission is to inspire creativity. Over 8,000* artists, leaders, and researchers from across Canada and around the world participate in programs at the Banff Centre every year. Through its multidisciplinary programming, Banff Centre provides individuals with the support they need to create, to develop solutions, and to make the impossible possible. The Banff Centre adds to Canada's and the world's cultural repertoire by commissioning, supporting, and producing new creative works.&nbsp;</p><p>Arts programs are at the core of The Banff Centre. Programming supports the commissioning and creation of new work by individual artists and arts collectives, and provides resources for collaboration and applied research. Training and professional development is offered at the post-graduate level in more than a dozen art forms including, music, theatre, dance, opera, Indigenous arts, literature, ceramics, print-making, painting, papermaking, photography, sculpture, audio engineering, digital film and video, and new media. Work is showcased in public performance, events, and exhibitions throughout the year, culminating in the annual Banff Summer Arts Festival; and is disseminated beyond Banff through Banff Centre LIVE. The Centre also partners with national and international arts institutions to bring art incubated in Banff to stages and concert halls around the world.</p><p><i><a href=\"http://www.banffcentre.ca\" target=\"_blank\">-</a><a href=\"http://www.banffcentre.ca\" target=\"_blank\">www.banffcentre.ca</a></i></p><h1 id=\"h:about-my-work\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">About My Work:</span></h1><p>The ten thousand-plus-year history of ceramics involves practically every culture around the world.  While the diverse forms and aesthetics of ceramics are based on those very cultures, the look of ceramics has also been greatly influenced by the source materials available and the technologies that continually evolved and changed them. As a studio artist, I embrace handcraft and digital methodologies as I work toward defining forms that are personally and culturally significant.  I use the vessel framework to explore social narratives, informed stylistically and conceptually by contemporary architecture. My work draws heavily from ceramic art practices from the seventies and eighties where the postmodern genre began to inform mainstream ceramic art. My work seeks to provide awareness of the role each individual plays in contemporary culture and inform the viewer of the challenges of existing within that culture.

The residency at Banff is entitled B.A.I.R: Banff Artist in Residence. I will attend Banff Centre from September 15, 2014 to October 25th, 2014. Though this residency is short compared to other residencies, it promises to inform my work by interdisciplinary collaboration and inspiration from the wide array of artists present.</p><p>Form &amp; Fire: 6@Banff is a title that refers to the number of pieces that will be produced at Banff Centre. The number six also refers to the number of weeks that I will attend this residency. Because of the time frame and the complexity of my ceramic work, I have decided on this number as it is a manageable expectation for output within the six week time frame. &nbsp;</p><p>The works produced at Banff will build upon themes explored in the works produced for my thesis&nbsp;exhibition that took place in April 2014. These pieces include the core ceramic piece, a wooden base, a lighting element, and a colored vitrine or Plexiglas enclosure. The goal is to complete the six ceramic pieces while the remaining components will be fabricated upon my return to the United States.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Weekly Timeline:</i></p><ul>\n<li>Week 1:  Banff arrival, studio set-up, facility orientation, introductions, make or purchase clay, begin press molding.</li>\n<li>Week 2:  Work on sculptural series continues. Press-molding continues and refining forms produced during week 1.</li>\n<li>Week 3:  Continue press molding, Clean and refine clay forms produced during week \nand week 2. Begin sculptural assembly.</li>\n<li>Week 4:  Continue assembly, prep work for drying</li>\n<li>Week 5:  Sculptures in the bisque fire. Prep studio for glazing, formulate glazing strategies.</li>\n<li>Week 6: Glazing of pieces beginning of week. Glaze firing</li>\n<li>Week 7: Transport work to Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.</li>\n</ul><p><i>Outline of Project Execution:</i></p><p>\tThe plan of the proposed project, as mentioned above in the weekly timeline, and barring any facility or material difficulties, will be completed in a timely and organized manner.  Upon arrival at Banff, I will set up my studio space, become familiar with the facility, staff, and programming. Studio set-up and preparation of the facility may take several days but no longer than one week. At the end of the first week, clay will be made or purchased, plaster molds will be prepared for use, and the determination will be made to purchase supplementary materials.\nThroughout weeks two through five, the majority of the clay assembly will occur.  During this time, clay will be press-molded and the resulting forms will be refined using forming and carving tools. Finally, finished clay forms will be assembled into six cohesive sculptures. If available, sculptures will be fired in place, meaning that they will be assembled in car kilns or on electric kiln stands. This method will ensure that the piece does not break during movement. Weeks five through seven will entail glazing of the assembled works and the preparation of completed works for transport.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:video-updates-corres\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">Video Updates, Correspondence, and Blog Posts:</span></h1><p>I fully expect my studio time at Banff Centre to be rigorous, however I fully intend to correspond to backers' questions and comments, as well as post videos that will document my progress as I move towards my residency output goal. I would also&nbsp;like to make available my written thesis for those interested in gaining a greater insight into my thesis work. This will be emailed to you upon request.

They provide a time of reflection, research, presentation and/or production. They also allow individuals to explore his/her practice within another community; meeting new people, using new materials, experiencing life in a new location. Art residencies emphasize the importance of meaningful and multi-layered cultural exchange and immersion into another culture. </p>\n<p>Some residency programs are incorporated within larger institutions. Other organizations exist solely to support residential exchange programs. Residencies can be a part of museums, universities, galleries, studio spaces, theaters, artist-run spaces, municipalities, governmental offices, and even festivals. They can be seasonal, ongoing, or tied to a particular one-time event. They exist in urban spaces, rural villages, and deep in nature. Hundreds of such opportunities and organisations exist throughout the world.</p>\n<p>Many times a residency experience is only the beginning of a longer relationship.

Backers must understand the difficulty of producing ceramic work in such a short amount of time. Also, ceramics is a very time consuming art form, loaded with potential for mishaps. I assure supporters that my expertise and work ethic is at the highest level. Backers will also be able to monitor the progression of the project on my website in the form of video blog entries. I will also keep the project on a concise schedule as stated in the above \"project description.\" In addition, my focus on the fabrication of 6 ceramic sculptures without the mixed media components ensures success of the project. It is important to note that the wood, lighting, and plexiglas aspects of these pieces will be completed upon my return to Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMzQ4ODUwNDIy","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":7,"number_of_comments_depth_all":1,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nYour financial contributions will help me to complete 6 new ceramic sculptures as a resident artist at Banff Centre in Alberta, Canada.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/737/968/ee5e0f043b80b00c77085f91e13de0d2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463688098&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=8a0ff393bbe986005087a78d8400c8f5","last_updated":"October 18, 2014","project_name":"orm & Fire: 6 Sculptures at Banff Centr","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"5,000","amount_of_pledged":"5,220","number_of_backers":"58","rate_of_funded":104,"project_we_love":true,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Banff, Canada","creator_name":"Wade Folger MacDonald","creator_location":"Lansing, MI","creator_description":"I am an artist and educator in the field of ceramics with an intense interest in the intersection between sculpture, design and emerging technologies. As an undergraduate, I studied ceramics and art education at Western Michigan University. Upon graduation, I traveled to Germany, Denmark, France, Italy, and the Czech Republic, developing my cultural competency, global awareness, and enthusiasm for art and design. I have since traveled to European countries five times and completed a research trip to the Bauhaus Archive in Berlin, the Bauhaus in Dessau, the Meissen Porcelain Factory in Meissen, and the Meissen Porcelain Museum in Dresden during the summer of 2012. International travel has expanded my artistic vision and and provides perspective to question current cultural and societal systems.  \r\n\r\nMusic continues to surreptitiously inform my creative research. My parents were opera singers and as a child music filled the air of our home and art covered the walls. Appropriately, my wife of thirteen years is an orchestral musician leading the viola section of West Michigan Symphony in Muskegon, Michigan and playing in the Grand Rapids Symphony in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Exposure to symphonic music both contemporary and classical, as well as, that provided by the expanded field of the performing arts is integral for my artistic growth and conceptual ideation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am in transition from student to professional artist. The process of completing my written thesis and the accompanying exhibition at the Zaha Hadid designed Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum in East Lansing, Michigan was a success. I am extremely fortunate to be the recipient of the John and Susan Berding Family Foundation Endowment Prize for my thesis work. In March, I participated in two juried exhibitions in addition to the thesis exhibition, the Michigan Emerging Graduate Artists Exhibition at the Urban Institute of Contemporary Arts in Grand Rapids, Michigan and the NCECA National Juried Student Exhibition at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.\r\n\r\nThis summer, I will participate in three national exhibitions: The Workhouse Clay National in Lorton, VA, the National MFA Competition at First Street Gallery in New York, NY, and the National  MFA Exhibition at Manifest Gallery, Cincinnati, OH. I have also been accepted to Banff Centre Artist in Residence for the fall and Anderson Ranch Artist in Residence in the spring of 2015.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1548363847,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":4,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.wfmceramics.com","domain":"wfmceramics.com"},{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/wade.f.macdonald","domain":"facebook.com"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/wfmceramics","domain":"twitter.com"},{"url":"http://www.art.msu.edu","domain":"art.msu.edu"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/941/162/b05647ad2f901ed02ae41b5bdf737303_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461550886&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=a2a8653c2482bce7c9f7f045888472db","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/448991557","top_cities_location_1st":"Kalamazoo United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"8","top_cities_location_2st":"East Lansing United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"7","top_cities_location_3st":"Lansing United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"7","top_cities_location_4st":"Battle Creek United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"3","top_cities_location_5st":"Grand Rapids United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"2","top_cities_location_6st":"Mattawan United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"2","top_cities_location_7st":"Mexico City Mexico","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Berlin Germany","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Jakarta Indonesia","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Angel Fire United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"54","top_countries_location_2st":"Germany","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_countries_location_3st":"Indonesia","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_countries_location_4st":"Mexico","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","number_of_new_backers":44,"number_of_returning_backers":14}
