It was an incredible drive through West Virginia and Pennsylvania, hills and hollows, incredibly beautiful. I drove through a very small town (one traffic light) called Paw Paw, West Virginia! I explained to the gas station attendant that I am from a town 5 minutes from Paw Paw, Michigan. They couldn't believe it!</p><p>Today, I am beginning the packing process in order to get a head start before my long journey to Banff Centre. The trip should take a little over 30 hours. I have planned to stop in Chicago on Friday (the day that I leave Grand Rapids) to meet up with Peter and Michael Jefferson at Wright Auctions. </p><p>Wright is the premier 20th century modern art and design auction house in the country. It will be nice to see PJ and MJ, as well as some amazing furniture and artwork. On Saturday morning, I will begin the long drive to Banff. </p><p>As of today, the Kickstarter funding campaign has reached 84% of its goal with much of the increase, since the last update, coming within a few hours during this last week. I am confident that the goal will be reached; however, it is important to keep the energy up and the momentum. Beginning next week, I will begin posting videos of what is happening at Banff Centre in order that all of the backers and non-backers alike can monitor the progress in the studio and see what Banff Centre is all about. </p><p>Thank you all!

What a town. Google Maps decided to take me through intense construction, 42nd street, Central Park Drive, and Broadway. Thanks to the miracle of technology, I was able to see some of the highlights of the city. I stayed with a friend and graduate of Pratt, Rogier Bak in Harlem. Rogier is a very talented graphic designer. In two weeks, I am headed back to the Washington D.C. area to pick up the piece from Workhouse Art Center.
