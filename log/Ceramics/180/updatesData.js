I do apologise for being generally rubbish at posting updates. I know this because kickstarter literally told me I've been bad at it.. hehe, oops! </p><p>If you haven't already, jump onto facebook or instagram and follow me there if you are interested in regular updates as I post almost every day on those accounts :)</p><p>instagram.com/sallyflannery</p><p>facebook.com/sallyflannerydesign</p><p>Soooo, since kickstarter ended, here is what has happened. Day one, I celebrated. I cried a little. It was lovely. </p><p>A month passed.. I was impatient, I stamped my foot a little.. I had to try and be patient (the number one rule of ceramics and yet something I generally suck at) ..kickstarter holds the money for a month so they can handle any disputed transactions and it collected all the money. A bunch of people who pledged backed out, that was a bit sad but overall still an awesome result. A month after it ended, they send me the money! Yaayy!</p><p>I bought a kiln that day. A week later it arrived :) The shelves were forgotten to be put in, so a few days later they came :) I have pretty much fired every single day since the kiln arrived. However, I have had some issues getting nice glaze results. This was sort of expected as every new kiln requires getting used to but it has been a frustrating teething stage.. Anyway, I finally feel like I'm getting nice results - in fact, there is a lot of cups in the kiln RIGHT NOW with some new glazes which will hopefully look lovely.. and that beautiful blue glaze, which I'm still trying to get to come out perfectly.. fingers crossed!</p><p>As for all your beautiful orders, I am making progress! I still feel confident that I will get everything out by the estimated delivery date (the end of August) even with almost 3x as many orders as anticipated! (thanks guys hehe) x</p><p>I will start sending orders out from next week.. basically, I am starting with cups since 90% of orders were cups... every week I will make and fire as many as humanly possible (while also working slowly and intentionally with each piece).. pack them all up on the weekend and have the courier pick them up every Monday. This will be happening for at least the next month. </p><p>When your order is sent out, I will try and send everyone a tracking number too since they will all be sent via courier. Keep an eye out on your emails for that :)</p><p>SHOULD YOUR ADDRESS CHANGE, please contact me or you should be able to change your address via kickstarter. I will just be sending them out to the addresses provided so please make sure they are correct :)</p><p>Also PLEASE (I know everyone is excited) but PLEASE don't message me and ask me to prioritise your order, unfortunately I just can't do this.. I wish I could but they are all important. It will sort of be luck of the draw since I will be firing similar glazes together and so on. </p><p>Another little note.. many of you know but for the sake of the beautiful planet we live on, I package in 100% compostable materials. I use popcorn for the majority of my padding in my packaging. If you happen to be allergic to corn/popcorn, please send me a message and let me know so I can arrange an alternative eco packaging. \"Death by popcorn\" doesn't look good for anyone haha!</p><p>Alright lovelies, I'm off to the sunshine to go sponge down some cups and make some more things to fill tomorrows kiln load.. Thanks again lovelies and I'll post again soon xx</p><p>Love and sunshine x</p><p>Sally</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"21838422\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/838/422/926fc0f75d9bc154bd10493fc4e783c2_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1531109758&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=dd670d39b725d2a7c63e74a1c5ca553a\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1528347409,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIyMDc1NjI=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Almost ready to choose glazes..","publishedAt":1528347409,"pinnedAt":null,"number":3,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Sally","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/939/135/a120d30156fe2c52193b8896bf2a7382_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1524106262&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=821065dd170b5ad1d317e368f01d2616","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":12,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1527060213,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIxOTQ3MjE=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"What happens now?!","publishedAt":1527060213,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Sally","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/939/135/a120d30156fe2c52193b8896bf2a7382_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1524106262&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=821065dd170b5ad1d317e368f01d2616","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":14,"commentsCount":4,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1526863182,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIxNjc5MTY=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"THANKYOU!","publishedAt":1526863182,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Sally","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/939/135/a120d30156fe2c52193b8896bf2a7382_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1524106262&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=821065dd170b5ad1d317e368f01d2616","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":10,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1526814001,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"AUD","amount":"2750.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"AUD","amount":"8046.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":95,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1524177713,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"AUD","amount":"2750.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"AUD","amount":"8046.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":95,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
