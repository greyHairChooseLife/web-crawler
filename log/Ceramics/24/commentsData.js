We are very proud of theses steins and do not feel it cheapens it in any way because they are imported from China.  Feel free to look up our main business Munktiki and see that we've been hand making ceramics in the United States for over 15 years.  Our business is family owned and operated and these side projects, like Munkstein, bring lots of business locally even though the product itself is imported.  Our entire family is supported by this business, we support other local artists by giving them the chance to design each new stein, we buy all packing material locally, use local shipping to send out your steins, and have a local family Freight forwarder company that works on getting our shipments to the USA.  In theory it would be wonderful to have the time and resources to make these wonderful steins in house, but that isn't realistic.  We didn't cause the crisis in shipping jobs overseas, we simply are changing with the times to keep our family business running to afford to buy locally and sustainably.  We make every effort to give business locally when we can, but when we started this amazing side project the best option for us, in order to give you an affordable stein, was to have them made in China.\n\nWe try to support as much local business as possible, but I love my Apple computer and iPhone.... both made in China. And btw... I have never stepped foot into or ever bought from Walmart.\n\n-Miles","createdAt":1437788526,"author":{"id":"VXNlci02NjM5MTY5Nzg=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/565/129/fbda6463366bc188d1f47522f71a8f71_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1461396138&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=63d67a7f3cfcbfe9b63e9e2d4f293e82","name":"Munktiki","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/663916978"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0xMDY4MzA3Mw==","body":"I have to agree with Eric.
