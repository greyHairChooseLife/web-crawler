Like everyone our year has been one strange up and down rollercoaster. The Kiln was finally fixed in February then all we needed was a check from an electrician, unfortunately this resulted in another couple hundred pounds. Nonetheless we finally had a kiln ready to go in March!</p>\n<p>Then lockdown happened…</p>\n<p>Megan had come down with a fever mid march (she's fine!)  and Adams partner was heavily pregnant (baby and mum also fine!), so like most we decided to keep to our homes and not visit the studio.</p>\n<p>Come July we happily returned and have since fired up the kiln a handful of times. As we are still learning to use the new controller, it has meant a slow process with the constant restrictions.</p>\n<p>BUT with all the doom and gloom aside - we are just completely over the moon. It has totally opened up our creative practice and now gives us the opportunity to start developing pottery classes and a kiln hire system. But most importantly it has meant we can start making all the work we owe our great backers!</p>\n<p>So please hold tight just a little longer as we make a start on the work. We are setting ourselves a deadline for August to have all the work completed and sent. This does seem a bit excessive but considering how many works we have to make and the process of drying and firing plus the constant risk of a possible lockdown we want to make sure to gives ourselves time. We do though have every intention to be finished much sooner!</p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram for updates on how the work is going and feel free to get in touch with any questions you may have.</p>\n<p>Stay safe and creative - love Megan and Adam x</p>\n<p>@adamdandoart</p>\n<p>@mmrdr</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1580662979,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI3NDUyODE=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Update!","publishedAt":1580662979,"pinnedAt":null,"number":3,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Megan M R Donfrancesco Reddy","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/010/461/799/68a6e4bbddb2f2974385b3ab9ac3eff9_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1569867147&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=53b1889d8ecc66683d63799c239bb523","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>We have a kiln!!!!!!!!

We are not a charity, we do have jobs and roofs over our heads but regardless of all that we are in that ‘stuck’ part of our lives plus we just don't have a spare £900! Both myself and Adam work very hard to balance home and families (Adam’s family is about 5 months off from getting even bigger!) plus the gallery, which is currently a very expensive hobby - but we are hoping that once this kiln is fixed it will move us onto the next chapter of our artistic career. For us it means a stable income because we will be able to be making more, selling more thus moving further away from the jobs which we do just to pay for the privilege of being an artist. Then the biggest bonus for us is an opportunity to offer something to the community - a kiln in the old town makes way for workshops and skill sharing. It brings more opportunity to the gallery and what we can do with the space, it will then go on to put West street on the map which is the long term goal!</p>\n<p>As a sculpture artist who works mostly with clay I have felt like I've been in limbo without a kiln so it really does mean the world to me to have it brought back to life. We are so touched by everyone who contributed. As soon as the kiln is up and running we will get on with making our gifts but in the mean time if we see you expect a massive hug and a pint in the pub!</p>\n<p>Love love love,</p>\n<p>Megan and Adam</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or want to come visit us at the studio give us a shout <a href=\"mailto:hello@thedirtyoldgallery.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hello@thedirtyoldgallery.com</a> - This weekend is the Winter Art Fair at The Dirty Old Gallery so one of us will be around.</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1575201600,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"GBP","amount":"900.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"GBP","amount":"901.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":26,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1572012732,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI2NjM3NTQ=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Incredible start!","publishedAt":1572012732,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Megan M R Donfrancesco Reddy","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/010/461/799/68a6e4bbddb2f2974385b3ab9ac3eff9_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1569867147&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=53b1889d8ecc66683d63799c239bb523","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Thank you so much to everyone who has got involved so far!
