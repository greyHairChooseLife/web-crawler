Myself and Adam both planned to get the kiln back to working order and started to save the funds needed to fix it - after a visit from a technician we discovered this would cost us around £900. It's a bloody big kiln.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Adam and Megan's studio \" data-id=\"26774042\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/774/042/d27f7f0792bbf59e7d73e0de1210a7ec_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1570633586&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=94fcecc6f0abe090add800ee49686f17\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Adam and Megan's studio </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>We both worked hard to raise the money while planning new projects such as pottery evenings and children's classes.

After a few talks with other artists and a couple late night chats in the pub we decided it was silly to not take it on - we could have a gallery and show other peoples work. We could run workshops, talks and local art projects. It felt silly to let the opportunity pass us by - so we put all the money we had saved into the gallery and from 2018 we were running The Dirty Old Gallery. We have had seven great exhibitions and run many workshops. Its been an amazing experience meeting new creatives and having a space to showcase them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"The poster to our first show at the gallery \" data-id=\"26774066\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/774/066/50618bb221cc8726d841ecde453e2ec4_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1570633698&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7d8a23d55e02586cf8ecbc0e15c836e7\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The poster to our first show at the gallery </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>But as great as it has been it has had a big affect on our own practice, the kiln has still not been fixed so neither of us have progressed with our own work. The Intention is to fix the kiln and start creating the work that we want to make plus having the ability to run our own pottery workshops and offer out the kiln to other local artists in need. The kiln will cost around £900 to fix - which seems like a lot to just fix something but brand new the kiln would cost thousands and we believe its better to fix up and take care of the old kiln. Its also very big machine which no one wants to have to move!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Painting by Adam Dando \" data-id=\"26774032\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/774/032/5985d6c0347bf115a264e5b996604238_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1570633543&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a39544497a4859544ad2b89724400f57\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Painting by Adam Dando </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Risks and challenges - We could end up making terrible work which no one ever buys.
