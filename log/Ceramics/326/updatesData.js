This Kickstarter campaign has only about 10 days left! I want to thank everyone who contributed so far. This mug will be great!</p>\n<p>Without tempting fate too much, I have started looking at production mold materials. The process is such that you make a mold of the master mold and use that mold to make production molds. This is necessary because the master mold usually is covered in mold release and pretty ugly (at least mine are). The production molds are cast from silicone molds and are clean and ready to accept slip once they completely dry. In Phoenix, that is a very short time table. I can make a mold and have it ready to cast in about three days.  Part of the funding for this Kickstarter will be the purchase of silicon mold material. I am looking at MoldStar 15 Slow (<a href=\"https://www.smooth-on.com/products/mold-star-15-slow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.smooth-on.com/products/mold-star-15-slow/</a>) as I have used it before and it gives a good result. Also, I don't have a vacuum degasser for some of the other tin-cure materials. Production molds mean I can get mugs done faster and get them to supporters quickly. With 10 production molds I could get 10 mugs done in a day. With one mold, 10 mugs would take ten days. It is an order of \"magma-tude\" faster. </p>\n<p>While we are not at the finish line, I wanted to give you some insight into my process. With luck on our side, these mugs will become a reality!</p>\n<p>-Tiki Tom</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1571780596,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI2NjA4OTM=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"I cannot believe it.","publishedAt":1571780596,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Thomas Adney","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/883/743/82ae1078e46e56cf3d8deb362aa44624_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1571343451&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=6b79b61bbc4cabcaf23834fb3bd2373d","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>What can I say?
