We believe in art and have witnessed what ceramics offers people. The joy and satisfaction that comes from making something beautiful from a lump of mud is something we believe should be available to the public. Time and time again I have met people who would love to be involved in making ceramic art but they do not have the money or space at their home for it. With out studio up and running we will be able to be that place in the community where people of all ages can come and enjoy ceramics!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The only challenge I see on the horizon is the hard work it will take for the studio to thrive.
