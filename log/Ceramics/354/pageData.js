I started making pottery in high school.  I went to the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and graduated with a bachelors of Fine Arts with an emphasis on ceramics.  During college I studied abroad for a year in Japan.  After graduation I took a job as a bookbinder for the University of Minnesota.  I worked there for 4 years paid off my student loans and saved my money. \r\n   I left the bindery and spent 9 months volunteering on organic farms through the WWOOF program.  I worked on a heirloom chicken farm, a vineyard in California, and a fruit farm in Hawaii.  Recently I went to a farm in Wisconsin that had goats, sheep, and guinea fowl.  \r\n   When I came back to Minnesota I purchased my land.  Since then I have been working part-time, making plans and getting permits, and clearing land when I can.  This is not a spur of the moment project I have been planing this for years.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1645500300,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":2,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.mrquins.com","domain":"mrquins.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/007/906/742/380b9c6bce6128cbdfc534447472940d_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461490304&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=b9a93e5a6f46205527d2fadaa3240d08","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1760242844","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Hello, my name is Craig \"Mr.Quin\" Johnson. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am building a 12 cubic foot top loading wood fired pottery kiln on 9 acres of land I bought near Willow River Minnesota. &nbsp;It is not a simple kiln though. &nbsp;Most wood fired kilns need a lot of wood to fire off. &nbsp;I am taking my former college professors kiln design and I am adding more insulation. &nbsp;By retaining more heat I hope to make the kiln more efficient. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Since my kiln will need less wood to fire off I can use more specific types of wood. &nbsp;For example I could use trimmings from apple orchards, hedge trimmings or fallen trees. &nbsp;Different woods produce different amounts of heat, ash, and trace elements. &nbsp;These differences in wood will cause different effects on the pottery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have also changed the fire box so It can be stocked(adding wood to the fire) from the top as well as the side. &nbsp;By stocking from the top I can burn anything I can pour in. &nbsp;Things like coffee grounds, corn, acorns, cherry pits, or nut shells. &nbsp;If I build an auger system this could feed the granular fuels into the firebox at a constant rate. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It won't be just my work that I fire. &nbsp;I plan on building a wood fired pottery studio where people can rent a kiln by the week. &nbsp;There will be micro cabins and studios that can be rented by the month or season. &nbsp;In time I hope to have at least 3 kilns on the property.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's not just pottery. &nbsp;Along with the studios I am building a small scale farm that will provide food for myself and those staying there. &nbsp;The goal is to be self sufficient. &nbsp;People come, live and work here to get away, live off the land for a bit, see if they like it.</p><p>&nbsp; The kiln Chamber is 4 feet long. 2 feet deep and 1.5 feet wide. &nbsp;That should hold 100-200 pieces. &nbsp;The top of the kiln is a 2 inch piece of ceramic fiber board that can be removed for easy loading and unloading. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have built two 1 cubic foot prototype kilns to test the firebox and design. &nbsp;I successfully fired the second one to cone 9 at 2150 degrees. &nbsp;These proto-types did not have the insulation of my final project but they still worked. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As rewards I am offering T-shirts that I designed and will print myself and wood fired pottery I made. &nbsp;The pottery will be shipped out as soon as possible. &nbsp;The T-shirts are available in men's and women's sizes. After I confirm the T-shirt orders I'll order the blank shirts. &nbsp;Begin printing the first of September and they will be sent out as they are finished. &nbsp;Shipping is included in the reward costs. &nbsp;If you purchase a ocarina, goblet, prototype goblet, or a strawberry pot contact me through my website to let me know which one you would like. &nbsp;I will then mark that one as sold.</p><p>&nbsp; I have set a goal of $4500 after kickstarter and amazon take a cut for their services then the cost of making and shipping the rewards I should have around $2500. &nbsp;That should be enough to build the kiln and a simple roof to protect it. &nbsp;If I should exceed my goal or have money left over I will use it to build a \"little brother kiln\". &nbsp;A smaller version of the first probably only 4-6 cubic feet.</p><p>&nbsp; For more information and images please see my website www.mrquins.com</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I am building the kiln near the middle of my property and I do not have a road yet.  I will begin construction of one this year but it won't be completed till sometime next year.  So I will have to carry the 600 bricks in from my neighbor's road.  Then I have to prep the site and build the kiln. Once the kiln is built I will add a shed to protect it from the rain, snow, and animals.  Time and labor is what I need.  Once the kiln is built I will need wood to fuel it.  I will be clearing a lot of trees.  However, it takes 10 minutes to cut down a tree and hours to clear it up and the split the wood.  Then it needs to be stacked to dry.  There are lumber mills around where I can buy their trimmings, but I would need a road for them to bring it in.  I hope to have the kiln completed late this fall.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":12,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 1</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 1</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Every little bit helps.

Though it depends on how the potter wants to fire it.  To create brighter colors a reduction atmosphere is needed.  Basically When the kiln is very hot you add more wood to the kiln then it can burn causing a reduction in the amount of oxygen.  The high temperatures and lack of oxygen changes the metal oxides and other chemicals in the clay and glaze forming bold more concentrated colors.  \n<br>   Reduction also causes smoke.  One way to remove the smoke is to add an empty chamber behind the ware chamber.  Within this chamber the extra carbon will have the time and oxygen it needs to burn off.  My kiln is too small for that.  However, my outer insulating wall will go around the bottom of the stack(the chimney) and may act like an empty chamber.  If I add air intakes to the stack it may cause secondary combustion in the stack burning off the smoke.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"type-12 navy-500 mb3\">\nLast updated: <time datetime=\"2014-07-26T13:17:34-04:00\" data-format=\"llll z\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sun, July 27 2014 2:17 AM UTC +09:00</time>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"],"top_cities_location_1st":"Reisterstown United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"2","top_cities_location_2st":"Bridgeport United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_cities_location_3st":"Gadsden United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_cities_location_4st":"Minneapolis United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_cities_location_5st":"New York United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_cities_location_6st":"Norman United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Philadelphia United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Windsor United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"9","number_of_new_backers":6,"number_of_returning_backers":4,"last_updated":"August 17, 2014"}
