Campbell Folk School, as well as a little downtown with a handful of shops and studios. The \"Folk School\" as it is referred to, was founded in 1925 \"to nurture and preserve the folk arts of the Appalachian Mountains\" and is a \"non-profit adult educational organization based on non-competitive learning\". The community at the folk school is strong, and folks travel to this rural mountain town to vacation, study, and &nbsp;immerse themselves in a new culture and community.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A local park in Brasstown, Little Brasstown Creek Park is the perfect place to go for a quiet walk in nature.\" data-caption=\"A local park in Brasstown, Little Brasstown Creek Park is the perfect place to go for a quiet walk in nature.\" data-id=\"5306450\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A local park in Brasstown, Little Brasstown Creek Park is the perfect place to go for a quiet walk in nature.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/306/450/39ad9ed73d7a870c2633dfdd99aaa33e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1454615799&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b32be9679fcf0db4e701535450512944\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A local park in Brasstown, Little Brasstown Creek Park is the perfect place to go for a quiet walk in nature.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>When we discovered we'd be moving to the area (after a long hunt for affordable, rentable farmland for my partner's goat dairy business), the opportunity to be near such a historically craft-centered community and the wealth of knowledge shared among the artists of Brasstown was an exciting prospect, especially for a young artist who still considers herself a student. I quickly began to crave my own studio space away from home and began seeking out spaces in downtown Brasstown, and was pleasantly surprised one day to see a \"FOR RENT\" on a terrific little place that was the perfect size. Plans and dreams for simply a ceramic studio began to shift into something larger and more community focused. Instead of limiting the space to one purpose, my partner and I decided to use this historic building on the corner of a busy intersection for several of the ideas that we had been discussing for a long time which we hoped would benefit and rejuvenate downtown Brasstown, and bring more people to the area.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Future Brasstown General Store &amp; Half Light Honey Studio\" data-caption=\"Future Brasstown General Store &amp; Half Light Honey Studio\" data-id=\"5306416\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Future Brasstown General Store &amp; Half Light Honey Studio\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/306/416/692d8c2b220ea44fa14cf8bd03e9ae31_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1454615440&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=536079422032a1a4e50d60b1a268c904\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Future Brasstown General Store &amp; Half Light Honey Studio</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>We decided to create essentially two businesses under one roof.

We would love to preserve and bring back some of the original intent of the space by making it a place to buy and appreciate local/regional arts &amp; crafts, farm-based goods, and gather together for good conversation and handicraft. With access to a large amount of acreage that is property of the buildings owner, we have permission to also utilize and enliven a community garden which we hope will continue to bring visitors and spark interest in the betterment of the downtown area.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"http://wcudigitalcollection.cdmhost.com/cdm/ref/collection/p4008coll2/id/3880\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Scroggs store interior with Fred O.

Campbell Folk School. Our local folklore traces the beginning of the Brasstown Carvers to Mrs. Campbell, who witnessed a group of men on the porch of Fred O. Scroggs’ general store, “idly whittlin’” with their pocket knives. When no spare wood was available, these self-proclaimed “sons of rest” would carve into the bench on which they sat. In an effort to preserve his bench, Fred O. drove nails into the length of the bench, which persistent carvers worked around. Mrs. Campbell saw the potential skill and productivity in these men and provided them with blocks of wood and direction.</a>\" (bench in previous image)</p><p>So far, we have held one community holiday market in the space that went over very well, and we have plans to continue holding local maker's markets throughout the year to provide a venue for local craftspeople as well as a fun atmosphere to shop seasonal gifts locally.

That is where the idea for the weekly classes, pottery painting during business hours/reservable parties, and workshops comes in. In order to make it happen by late spring/early summer, some things need to be in place, including :</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Break Down of Costs:</span></p><p>-A programmable electric kiln (with installation) ($1300) and Ventilation ($400)</p><p>-Work tables and seating ($250)</p><p>-Shelving and Storage ($125)</p><p>-Advertising &amp; Website ($175)</p><p>-Art Supplies &amp; Basic Materials ($100)</p><p>-Bisqueware, Underglaze, Brushes, Etc. ($400)</p><p>-Sink ($200)</p><p>-Glazing Materials ($200)</p><p>-Reward fulfillment supplies ($250)</p><p>Total: $3400</p><p><span class=\"bold\">How soon will the campaign benefits be in action?</span></p><p>Once the work area is all set up, classes and workshops will be all set to begin as soon as we have our Grand Opening set for late spring/early summer. We will have in-person registration, as well as way to sign up on the website, and last minute drop-ins available when the 10-person class capacity isn't full.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"5315576\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/315/576/56da09bafc4d596d3a17404f9bf605cb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1454766364&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=dd675dca44ba25d293cc2d0b6a571b81\" data-airgap-id=\"35\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">What makes me qualified to teach?</span></p><p>Besides around 25 years of personal art-making, I will be instructing the children's art classes and adult workshops with experience gained from my studies at Florida State University where I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Studio Art and minor in Art History. &nbsp;After graduating I gained more hands-on experience via assistant teaching pre-school aged children at Asheville Montessori School and Lead Instructing at Roots and Wings School of Art and Design in Asheville, NC. I also have experience running the <a href=\"https://union.fsu.edu/artcenter/\" target=\"_blank\">Oglesby Union Art Center at FSU</a> where I was in charge of Paint-A-Pot and studio maintenance/management and also taught private hand-building courses. These experiences were very inspiring and fulfilling for me, and I look forward immersing myself once more in the world of teaching, as well as facilitating adults and children alike in their pottery painting pursuits!&nbsp;I also hope to offer paid internships and work-trades in exchange for studio &amp; kiln access for those who would like to learn the many aspects of running a production ceramic studio, and having these items in place will also make that possible.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">What will a typical children's art class look like?</span></p><p>Classes will be one hour long and 8 weeks in duration. Themed classes will take place one-two days per week depending on the season/demand and will be broken up into a 3-5 year old Mommy/Daddy &amp; Me class, a 6-9 year old class, and a 10-13 year old class. We will always have a warm-up time to sketch, followed by a brief art history or theory lesson that will pertain to the main project for the day, and after a demo, about half an hour-45 minutes to begin a new work or finish a project started the week before, with guidance and assistance throughout. Lessons will always be planned with cognitive skill and development in mind, but the main themes will remain consistent throughout age groups. Examples of eight week courses include mixed media &amp; collage, environmental art, drawing &amp; painting, sculptural and functional ceramics, printmaking, and <span class=\"bold\">more</span>!</p><p><span class=\"bold\">How does Pottery Painting work?</span></p><p>Just walk in on any day where we are open, choose a bisque (that's unglazed) piece of pottery, and we will set you up with brushes and underglaze paints as well as ideas for ways to decorate your piece! Stencils, slip-trailing, drawing and filling with paint, sponging on...the&nbsp;possibilities for designs are endless!Can't finish in a day? That's okay! Finish your piece over the course of hours or up to 3 days for that extra-detailed masterpiece. Then, when you're finished, we'll take care of&nbsp;the clear glaze topcoat and firing your work to glossy perfection. The final result will be ready for pickup in one week (*or sooner upon&nbsp;request + a small fee). Want to throw a party? Reserve the entire workspace for your next birthday or group celebration and bring refreshments to share!</p><p><span class=\"bold\">THANK YOU for taking the time to read and consider my ideas, and I hope you will find my project to be one worth investing in.

I plan to do my best to utilize my marketing skills gained through promoting my own business online and via social media by applying those skills to advertising for classes, workshops, and everything that this space will have to offer. Due to the lack of nearby competition, and what I feel is a void that this business will fill within this mountain community and those that surround it in the ti-state areas of Eastern TN and North Georgia, I do not foresee too much difficulty garnering enough interest for the humble goals in mind. Also, due to the fact that this business will be so diversified, a slow period shouldn't pose a large threat to the business functions overall. \r\n\r\nThe only other risk is that of timeline setbacks with reward delivery due to the somewhat unpredictable aspects of creating pottery as rewards. Mistakes happen and kilns don't always fire to a potter's liking, but I spaced the delivery of rewards mindfully and realistically in order to not rush the process and give myself plenty of time to overcome mistakes and imperfections, should they occur.
