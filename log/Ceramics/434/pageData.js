I fell in love with pottery in high school and college but have had limited access to studios as my schedule often doesn’t mesh with hours of operation. This Kickstarter will help me buy my own equipment and materials, allowing me to work independently from within my own home studio. My desire is to buy a new wheel, kiln, clay, and all the tools accessible to me at our local studio. Having my own equipment will allow me to create more and grow a successful side business to support my growing family.</p>\n<p>My desire is to create functional pieces that can be used daily in kitchens and homes across the country. The first fruits of my new equipment will be sent to my wonderful backers. This project is a great way for me to grow my skills and gain the necessary equipment to launch my new small business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"28755909\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/755/909/cdd035a082d1bf9c244266a7870674fc_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1587086893&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a8acb9bef3bdacd095e051cf8ff87f3d\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n<p>.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Making pottery is often full of surprises. Glazes don’t turn out as expected, pieces unexpectedly crack, etc. Regardless, all backers will receive their reward in a timely manner but maybe a tad bit later than expected. As I am and always will be my biggest critic, I will not mail anything unless I would personally use it and be excited to receive it. Shipping and handling are another set of challenges as shipping costs will vary and pottery is ultimately fragile. All creations will be packaged securely to eliminate as much opportunity for damage as possible.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 20</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSmall Tumbler Cup\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>One handmade small tumbler cup.
