Because they are handmade, and I will be glazing each one differently, each is slightly different and individual, and whilst the basic shape will be similar, your rooster will not be identical to those pictured (unless you happen to receive one of the ones photographed!).\n<br>Pledge includes shipping within Ireland; a very small additional charge is applied to backers outside Ireland.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-04-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Apr 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n5 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (85 left of 90)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">€100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 99</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\n5 for 4\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Five lovely and individual Roosters, winging their way to you for the cost of four.
