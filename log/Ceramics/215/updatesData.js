After much deliberation, I decided to pull out of the deal. This left me having paid out for materials, packaging, and staff costs, to name just some of the costs incurred. It has, frankly, left my business in some debt. It also left me with a bulk lot of Ceramic Pixies on my studio shelves. They are a little different to the figures I usually supply to shops an private sale, as there are hundreds of them in the exact same colour options. Consequently, I’ve decided to offer them at a greatly reduced price through a crowd funding campaign, in the hope of paying off the debts incurred from making them. I would be very grateful if you would take a look at the campaign, and if possible, support it, and also, most importantly, share it too. My New Kickstarter is now LIVE but the majority of the pledge options do not open until 12.01 am BST on Monday 1st May to give fair warning of the Earliest Bird Special Offers. There are limited Pixies Pairs available at LESS THAN THE USUAL WHOLESALE PRICE - that means you can get a PAIR of pixies for less than the usual Retail price of one single figure. PLEASE check it out, share the link, and remember to check back on Monday when the rewards open. For retailers, there is a reward level for you to pledge for 12 pairs at less than the usual wholesale cost.  \n </p><p>\nThe link is here:</p><p> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/173467920/these-pesky-pixies</p><p>\n\nApologies if you get this notification more than once - some of you have baked more than one of my campaigns (thank you!) and some of you I also have email addresses in my address book for.\n\nThank you, Hope to meet you all again in the Pixie campaign :) </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1488751514,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE4MjM1Njc=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Ready to come home to roost :)","publishedAt":1488751514,"pinnedAt":null,"number":6,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Jeanette Everson","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/974/971/0f2c1f8438efc43a12a12436fc6172d5_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461656923&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=2a4c3b40aa30e1ee1121a93444b0b8f0","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>I spent this afternoon boxing things up...  lots of elves for shops, a few new bears, but most importantly, a whole flock of Roosters!  They will be posted out in the next few days - not tomorrow unfortunately as my lovely husband tipped my van into a huge pothole on Friday so I have no transport to get to the Post Office till it's fixed :(  But all the packages are packaged and ready with customs declarations and little blue airmail stickers and your addresses and all that, so they are nearly on the way.  Here's a few more who came out of the kiln this week...  Only one person contacted me to choose a specific bird, so the rest of you are getting surprises!  Practice being amazed.  </p><p>Lots of love, as always xxx</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15751409\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/751/409/b3370fe4ea80e935631f202d526a1225_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1488751467&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=fd28ff3a95936f93dc85366f99d27e67\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15751400\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/751/400/9830db49daa8f5415e990ef8c77c971f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1488751426&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4c43e08f9b5302529b4226ded18d7257\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p> They'll be with you in time for Easter Dinner :)</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1487965977,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE4MTU4Nzc=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Important info for my lovely backers","publishedAt":1487965977,"pinnedAt":null,"number":5,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Jeanette Everson","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/974/971/0f2c1f8438efc43a12a12436fc6172d5_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461656923&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=2a4c3b40aa30e1ee1121a93444b0b8f0","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":3,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1487635200,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"EUR","amount":"500.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"EUR","amount":"560.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":9,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1487520278,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE4MTExNjI=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Cock-a-doodle-done!","publishedAt":1487520278,"pinnedAt":null,"number":4,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Jeanette Everson","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/974/971/0f2c1f8438efc43a12a12436fc6172d5_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461656923&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=2a4c3b40aa30e1ee1121a93444b0b8f0","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":3,"commentsCount":2,"body":"<p>Oh thank goodness!!!  For a small campaign, I was beginning to think it might plummet like a plucked chicken heading to Sunday Dinner!</p><p>That'll teach me to badly plan and badly promote and erm...
