I use these materials to represent my Western culture and my cultural journey through my creativity. \r\n\r\nAs Liverpool was the first city in Europe to establish a China Town, the surface decoration on my work represents the history of trade between Hong Kong and Liverpool as a lot of trade centuries ago would come directly from Hong Kong to the Albert Docks, bringing art, spices and other various forms of culture on the trade ships.\r\n\r\nMy work also takes inspiration from shipwreck pottery, specifically Chinese pottery that was on its way to the Western world such as the Albert Docks in Liverpool. Pottery recovered from shipwrecks adorned by coral and sea life, produces natural textures and earthy colours that have built up over time, this is something that I have recreated with my surface treatments.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Jacob Arthur Chan","creator_last_login":1531505756,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/jchanceramics/","domain":"instagram.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/694/342/b38af8380eb9dde52d45662a20f5746a_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1529951982&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=418c0194443d6fe5d866485e2e7d5615","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1003598452","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Hello! My name is Jacob, I'm 22 years old and I’m a ceramicist based in Liverpool, in the North West of England. \nI make bespoke, hand-crafted ceramic artworks. \nBeing proud of my heritage, my pieces are heavily influenced by Asian shapes and decorated with handmade, mythical Chinese forms, in combination with an array of layered surface techniques.\nNo two pieces are the same in colour or design. \nI intend to pursue a career in ceramics and to do so will need to invest in essential equipment for my studio. My aim is to raise enough money to build Liverpool’s first soda kiln!</p><p>Once built, I hope to run master classes and workshops for the public and to offer the space to artists who don't have access to the necessary facilities and equipment. \nNot only will it help to progress my own work but I believe that it will also strengthen the art community as a whole, as there are very few who specialise in this particular style of ceramics.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">What is soda firing?&nbsp;</span></p><p>Soda firing is a process whereby unglazed ware is fired to high temperatures, using either gas or wood, and soda is introduced to produce a vapour that glazes the ware. This produces characteristic effects that can only be achieved through this type of firing. In short, soda firing is a very demanding and intensive way to paint with fire.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"University Soda Kiln\" data-caption=\"University Soda Kiln\" data-id=\"21817273\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"University Soda Kiln\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/817/273/3134d039d45e1f1c98842c212a5918a2_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1530894553&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=f027ac0ffc5e5dafa4cacdb8bbdc4f99\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">University Soda Kiln</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Introducing soda into the kiln\" data-caption=\"Introducing soda into the kiln\" data-id=\"21817292\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Introducing soda into the kiln\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/817/292/28480c75fc6b623dc07c0e1a10a8c023_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1530894686&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b25c3b6168da0fe5efc60b785cfb442f\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Introducing soda into the kiln</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A packed soda kiln, ready for firing.\" data-caption=\"A packed soda kiln, ready for firing.\" data-id=\"21817327\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A packed soda kiln, ready for firing.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/817/327/b99f18d006f1d4dd546ba49489a670a8_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1530894862&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b6fb55887ee358a874fe68814d62aeea\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A packed soda kiln, ready for firing.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">My Future Plans...</span></p><p>In the short term, the main goal is building a soda kiln. However, in the not-too-distant future, I hope to expand my business and open a pottery centre, which can facilitate myself, other artists and members of the public. I hope to be able to build a Pottery which can provide opportunities for younger generations, such as through the provision of apprenticeships, which will offer the skills and training needed to become an established and experienced ceramicist.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Rewards and P&amp;P</span>&nbsp;</p><p>All standard rewards will be ready before Christmas, so it will be a great opportunity to buy a unique gift for a loved one (or just to treat yourself!), at the same time as helping me to get one step closer to achieving my goal.
