I am getting very close to the finish line for all the original pledges (excluding the \"bonus\" pledges whose cups will be delivered in May). I've sent you all a final opportunity to change your mailing address, and once I've got everyone's final address, I'll start popping some packages in the mail this week! I've decided to stagger my shipping a bit, since there are several shipments to go out and our local small-town post office might prefer not to be buried all at once with packages!
