The process of forming the clay is very dear to me and it is always enlightening to hear others’ perspectives. By studying the history of clay, I have gained invaluable insight and appreciation of cultures around the world. Our ancestors are studied through their use of clay; to study something as historical and traditional as <i>satoyama </i>is like experiencing a living history, and it is an opportunity that melds the forces of the two things that are most inspirational to me. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Chloe Rahimzadeh\" data-caption=\"Chloe Rahimzadeh\" data-id=\"3774061\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Chloe Rahimzadeh\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/774/061/3b58de77591e61d9e0160ff33014efbb_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1431392243&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=0fab110944bbac3eb8d700d7d7db7aca\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Chloe Rahimzadeh</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Christian Morris:</span>\nI am a ceramic artist and acting student. I am interested in exploring activities which expand my capacity for empathy and self-awareness. I find that ceramics, like acting, pulls me into a state of flow where I become so fully engaged with the task at hand that the line between my personal identity and the clay becomes blurred. When working with clay I see clearly the connection between myself and the environment. While in the process of creating I become aware of the fact that I am not in control of the clay as some outside manipulating force, but that the clay and I have entered into a collaboration in which mutual respect is the unstated agreement. If I give the clay my undivided attention and care, it will, in turn, allow me the opportunity to express myself.  If I am lucky, the clay will expose something in me that expands my understanding of what it means to coexist. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Christian Morris\" data-caption=\"Christian Morris\" data-id=\"3774544\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Christian Morris\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/774/544/785e478d213b0d200ee44907e8dee122_original.PNG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1431397526&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=9a3b9b8921a3d02d3e16a463599459b9\" data-airgap-id=\"33\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Christian Morris</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Han Haley Nguyen: </span>I am a Vietnamese American ceramicist who was born and raised in Vietnam until the age of 9. My unique background is an inspiration for my work as I explores the concept of identity and material world through the different mediums. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree at California State University, Channel Islands in 2014. During my time at CSUCI, I was the President of CSUCI Ceramics &amp; Sculpture Club, and Secretary of the CI Artist Club. I also worked closely with my mentors as a student assistant for the ceramics and sculpture studio. In the summer of 2013, I traveled back to Vietnam to independently research the traditional Vietnamese ceramics and kiln site at Lo Lu Wares in the province of Binh Duong. In 2014, I traveled to Echizen, Japan to further my research on ceramics.

My interest stemming from the possibility of finding and understanding connections that surpass borders, belief systems, and economic systems, and of which can give way to endless possibilities. My life is encased in moments of absolute juxtapositions from sugarcane fields in Mexico, to suburbs of Southern California. I have become a mosaic of experiences of which I have come to understand are all connected to a larger idea or concept. And it is with this curiosity and my background in political science that I hope to take my next journey, to research and study a way of life that may hold the answer to our partition. How can we as humans connect our traditions, our cultures, and our environment, and as corny as it may sound, be as one?

Thankfully, we will be traveling with bilingual member of the Vibrant Lands NPO. \r\n\r\n•What space will be used for the residency?\r\n\r\nMaster Potter Shimizu Chiyoichi in Tamba is collaborating with Vibrant Lands NPO and has offered his father's fallow studio space to be revitalized into a working studio for future artist residents.\r\n\r\n•What kind of equipment and kiln is available there? Where will the artwork be produced?\r\n\r\nWe will have access to Master Potter Shimizu’s own personal studio and kiln space to produce limited-edition work. We plan to partake in the 50 chamber Noborigama Kiln ceremonial firing in October. Our limited-edition works will be fired within one of the chambers sponsored through the kickstarter.\r\n\r\n•What sort of contacts do you have? What kinds of connections do you plan to make in Japan?  \r\n\r\nWe will be working with Shimizu Chiyoichi and local Tamba potters. We also plan to meet with Kobe University satoyama researcher, Mieko Kiyono.  \r\n\r\n•How will this residency program become sustainable?\r\n\r\nWe are the Vibrant Lands NPO pilot program; our contribution is to write and create film documentation of our research and experiences for further grant proposals and fundraising. The networks established through this kickstarter will generate further interest in the residency to bring awareness to the transformative and sustainable connections of satoyama.\r\n\r\n•How will you transport the rewards from Japan?\r\n\r\nWe will ship works from Japan, but plan to pack and carry the most valuable rewards back to the U.S.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold
