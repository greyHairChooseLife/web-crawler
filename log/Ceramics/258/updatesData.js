If you are giving the houses as a gift, you may prefer to unwrap the pumpkins and arrange them more artistically. Obviously the wood-shavings will also wriggle around in transit too, so again, you may want to repack them if necessary before giving as a gift. </p><p>As ever, thank you from the bottom of my heart and the depths of my kiln.
