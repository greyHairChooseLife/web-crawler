I moved here for a fresh start, I've had a pretty rough couple of years and I'm ready to be somewhere beautiful and meet new people. I would love to go back to school for Special Ed or Art Ed. I love working with kids and special needs kids. Eventually, the goal is to have my own ceramics studio where I can offer free/affordable classes to the community. I would also love to get into recreational art therapy for people with special needs or who suffer from mental illnesses like depression and anxiety. \r\nSo far I love Colorado! I've been doing lots of hiking when I'm not at work. I've also been doing a lot of research into local rentable studio spaces where I can potentially set up shop, and trying to meet other local artists.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1579403215,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.facebook.com/ShandasCeramics","domain":"facebook.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/320/123/5233d0e20956985809a08642475060fc_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461579492&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=0b8026294dde5ae8d7c6ef0f324a9cad","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1764364169","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>I discovered my love for ceramics while earning my Bachelor's degree in Psychology. I took some ceramics courses for electives and fell in love with it. I struggle with depression and anxiety and ceramics is my therapy, so to speak. It helps me relax and focus my energy into something positive.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last couple of years, my life has been pretty much a disaster. I had some extreme personal issues leaving me broke and jobless. I can't get a job in my field without a master's degree, and I would love to go back to school but my undergrad student loans are draining my finances. I'm stuck working retail/customer service jobs not even making enough money to fund any ceramics projects.&nbsp;</p><p>I would be so grateful for any help to jumpstart this process of starting my side business to help me be able to afford Grad school. I have so much accrued debt (school loans and credit cards I had to live off of during my financial crisis) that I can't even afford supplies right now. I've pretty much sold everything I own to pay bills, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually want to use my given talent to benefit the community: giving free art lessons, working with special needs people to help them express themselves, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks so much for considering helping me. You will not be sorry!!&nbsp;</p><p>Check out my pieces on facebook:</p><p>www.facebook.com/ShandasCeramics</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The only setback I can think of is that sometimes ceramics can be fragile/unpredictable. You can take all the proper precautions to ensure your products don't break during the firing process, but sometimes it's inevitable that a small amount of damage can occur. However, I have only had this happen a couple of times and now I usually make extras of everything possible, just to overcompensate for issues like this.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":3,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A small, personalized clay piece made by your's truly (example: ornament, pendant, etc.)</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-01-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Jan 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A small piece hand-crafted by your's truly (example: small figure/sculpture)</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-01-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Jan 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Large, unique piece hand-crafted by your's truly.
