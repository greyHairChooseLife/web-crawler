This means that while I have skills, energy, and ideas (lots\nand lots of ideas!), I do not have much inventory yet. This is where the kiln\ncomes in; if I have a kiln, I can produce work to exhibit and sell, but without\na kiln… well, I can make whatever I want, but it doesn’t do anybody any good if\nI can’t fire it. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"- a somewhat Chinese-style dragon I carved on a vase -\" data-caption=\"- a somewhat Chinese-style dragon I carved on a vase -\" data-id=\"113797\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"- a somewhat Chinese-style dragon I carved on a vase -\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/000/113/797/8c47d4a6d9b77ac8af61ca20b2aaa758_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1344978174&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8d4b2e7257c4a352e4d4c0eaca9183fd\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">- a somewhat Chinese-style dragon I carved on a vase -</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As\nfor my ideas, I mentioned dragons above. Dragons (and other mythical beasts as\nwell) are fascinating to me. They are entirely imaginary creatures, and yet\nhumans have been writing about them and drawing pictures of them for much of\nhistory. Sometimes they are nasty and sometimes they are wise, but they are\nalways powerful and magical. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"- dragon on wheels on mug -\" data-caption=\"- dragon on wheels on mug -\" data-id=\"113805\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"- dragon on wheels on mug -\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/000/113/805/a8a461fcd8b71fb8aa4e6ddb3c06ef09_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1344978488&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=38b2f516f7bee6a716542bba40baa305\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">- dragon on wheels on mug -</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I\nlike to think that I am re-imagining dragons, and questioning the way people\nthink about them. What do I mean when I say re-imagining dragons, you might\nask? What was wrong with them in the first place? It’s not so much that I think\nprevious stories about dragons were “wrong,” but rather that I am embracing the\nidea that dragons are defined differently in different places and by different\npeople. I can place my own definitions on them, and that creates the potential\nfor all sorts of exciting stories and art. I can make dragons that are the size\nof a cat who catch mice for dinner, or I can create a seascape on a vase that\nincludes an enormous sea dragon carrying a ship on its back. I enjoy\nchallenging and playing off of elements of pre-existing dragon stories to\nre-make them into new ideas.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"- tiny sgraffito dragon leaping across mushrooms on serving bowl -\" data-caption=\"- tiny sgraffito dragon leaping across mushrooms on serving bowl -\" data-id=\"113806\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"- tiny sgraffito dragon leaping across mushrooms on serving bowl -\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/000/113/806/e59c9f33aaa6624d19e75553d4aef70f_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1344978592&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e41e00ddaf3030052ea0873ca55ab80e\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">- tiny sgraffito dragon leaping across mushrooms on serving bowl -</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">The project:</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m very interested in\ncommunicating with customers to make something special for them. This project\nisn’t just about getting me a kiln so that I can make what I want to make. I\nwant to find out how it works to have people tell me what they are interested\nin me making. I have offered a wide range of items over in the rewards section.\nYou’ll notice that as the price of the reward goes up, so does the flexibility\nof what you can choose. The things at the upper levels are going to be entirely\ncustom designed. I am also offering a reward at the $50 level that is custom\nmade – a one-of-a-kind item that I will make just for you. What special item do\nyou wish you could have?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have selected items to\noffer that I plan to continue to develop into product lines in the future. But\nI am (very!) open to suggestions and design ideas. By taking part in this\nproject, you will have the opportunity to ask for specific things if you desire\nto. On the other hand, if you just want one of the items in the rewards column\nand don’t have any special requests, I will still be eternally grateful and\nhappy to make your piece. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Depending on your\nfeedback, I will decide how to offer commissioned and custom work in the\nfuture. This project has multiple angles; it is a way for me to get the kiln\nthat I want and get it installed safely, a way for me to get my work out to a\nwider audience (you! and all your friends!), and an experiment in communication\nand collaboration with those who are interested in purchasing and supporting my\nwork. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">How it works:</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I plan to fund the\npurchase and installation of the kiln completely with money from pre-orders of\nmy work. The idea here is that you pledge to purchase an item (Kickstarter\ncalls them “rewards”), and that pledge goes toward my goal, which is the price\nof purchasing and setting up the kiln.

I spent all my time outdoors inventing stories and examining wildlife, or indoors writing down the stories and drawing pictures of the creatures I saw. It was a major breakthrough when I realized at the age of 11 that I could also draw imaginary things like dragons, rather than just writing about them. At that time I also joined the school band playing trumpet and set out to become a musician. I pursued this course in a very driven and focused way until I went to college early, just after finishing my sophomore year of high school, and became interested in playing all the instruments. \r\n\r\nIt was then that I discovered clay and remembered my dragons, both the drawings and the stories. At first ceramics was just for fun, but when I realized that I needed to choose between ceramics and other classes, I discovered that it had become a vital part of my education and interests. My senior thesis was a year-long sculpture project that included large clay tree stumps and logs, six small dragons, and a story written in three-inch-tall letters above the display. \r\n\r\nThis is how I came to be a music major who produced a ceramics thesis. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in December 2011 at the age of 20. I still play various instruments at various times, but now my drive and focus are on ceramics.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1434719216,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":4,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.riverdragonceramics.blogspot.com","domain":"riverdragonceramics.blogspot.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/658/844/1f37566aa4fc838ff7eb089b65760291_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461402894&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=e5423721e5ba4500f2ec1adf09e50f4d","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/317283323","top_cities_location_1st":"Bangor United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"3","top_cities_location_2st":"Great Barrington United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"3","top_cities_location_3st":"Los Angeles United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"3","top_cities_location_4st":"San Francisco United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"3","top_cities_location_5st":"Alexandria United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"2","top_cities_location_6st":"Chicago United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"2","top_cities_location_7st":"San Antonio United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"2","top_cities_location_8st":"San Diego United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"2","top_cities_location_9st":"Toronto Canada","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Vancouver Canada","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"91","top_countries_location_2st":"Canada","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"2","top_countries_location_3st":"Sweden","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_countries_location_4st":"United Kingdom","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","number_of_new_backers":39,"number_of_returning_backers":59}
