I have some lovely news for you this Monday. With the second glaze firing of my shiny new kiln last week, a whole bunch of rewards are on their way! </p><p>If you ordered: a pendant or pendants only, a swirl bowl, or a single 4 inch bowl, then your reward is currently in the mail! If you ordered a small dragon, there is a 37 percent chance that your reward is on the way! If I've already contacted you with a picture of your custom reward, it is either on its way or about to be packed into a box for you! </p><p>How to tell if your reward shipped today: I'll be sending out emails by midnight tonight to everyone for whom I have shipped a package. If you don't get an email from me tonight, your reward isn't ready to go yet. </p><p>In the next firing, I will finish: soap dishes, more small dragons (there are a bunch of these, and they take a while to make, so I'm doing about six at a time), and teapots/tea sets. I'm also starting in on the custom rewards this time around. Keep in mind that there are 22 of you custom reward folks, so if you haven't heard from me in a while... I'm probably working on other rewards right now. </p><p>News about the kiln: It's great! The kiln is performing very well. It fires very evenly, and is easy to program. It holds a lot of work - I fired 42 pieces in it this time around, and I think I could have squeezed in a few more. Thank you, backers! You made this possible with your pre-orders! The work I'm making for you has priority for that kiln space.</p><p>Do feel free to contact me any time if you have questions or comments! My email address is vkelley07@simons-rock.edu.

I thought for sure the cement board would fit in my car. My trunk is pretty big and I can make it bigger by folding down the back seats. But the opening between the passenger compartment and the trunk is about 1.5 inches too small to fit three foot cement board through. So we had to tie my trunk partially shut, and I drove home with my hazard lights on. We arrived just fine, although the main road here is pretty bumpy so we took a detour on a nice new road to avoid smacking things around too much. </p><p>            Unfortunately the local hardware store wanted to charge us more for the cinder blocks than we have room for in the budget, so in the next couple days we'll be headed up to the one in the next town over, which will most certainly be cheaper. 54 cinder blocks add up! But it'll be easier to put them down on the uneven barn floor than cement board. (The cement board is for the wall.) </p><p>            To see pictures, go to my blog: <a href=\"http://riverdragonceramics.blogspot.com/2012/08/kickstarter-update-fireproofing.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://riverdragonceramics.blogspot.com/2012/08/kickstarter-update-fireproofing.html</a></p><p>            Backers!
