His work was the most exquisite I had ever seen and inspired me to take up ceramics as my primary form of art. I was immediately attracted to the endless creative possibilities that three-dimensional art lends itself to. My plan upon graduating from college was to become a full time artist but I graduated in 2008, just as the economy crashed. I decided to take the safer route of the business world and eventually started my own business. Life took over but I never lost the dream of finding studio space.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike painters or most other kinds of artists, a ceramic artist must use large and expensive equipment. The kiln, slab roller, and pottery wheel alone each cost $1000-$3000, and they take up a lot of space. Finding a studio that will allow a kiln is also difficult. But one day I found some artist cottages in a park in downtown Bonita Springs, FL, near where I live and paddle on the river. It took years for one of these cottages to become available. The city advertised for applications and I was chosen out of many applicants for the only available cottage. Now I just have to fill the studio with the equipment I need to begin creating my artwork again after almost 10 years. And I need your help!</p><p>During the 10 years I've been waiting, I've been dreaming up a series of pieces shaped like water droplets similar to a piece I created some time ago. A collector could purchase one or more of them and display them all together. Installed hanging from a ceiling, a collection of these beautiful droplet pieces would look like rain. Each piece would be unique and intricately designed. Although Kickstarter won't allow it for rewards, my future plans for this series involve donating a portion of the proceeds toward helping with water conservation issues like the Flint water crisis or the Lake Okeechobee releases.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, Kickstarter is an all or nothing venture. If we don't reach the goal in the time allotted, backers do not get charged and Upriver Ceramics gets no funding. So help me spread the word if you really want to see this come to fruition like I do!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"This is an example of the larger &quot;water drop&quot; reward.\" data-caption=\"This is an example of the larger &quot;water drop&quot; reward.\" data-id=\"5652186\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"This is an example of the larger &quot;water drop&quot; reward.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/652/186/8443322e71aa29353beb59540276f2c8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459802481&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=277d458efb373ec23902e884907c1236\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">This is an example of the larger \"water drop\" reward.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"This is another angle of the larger &quot;water drop&quot; reward idea.

And when I did, it was with a high-fire gas kiln. The city won't allow a gas kiln in the artist cottage because it is also in a public park, so I will have to learn to make everything in an electric low-fire kiln. But I have done my research and consulted other current ceramic artists I know who use them all the time. They've assured me that the quality of my work will be the same and the low-fire glazes have come a long way since the last time I used them. I am confident in my ability to run the kiln myself.\r\n\r\nAlso, I will be continuing to run my business, so time could be a tricky thing to overcome. But I have been waiting so long to get back into a studio, I know I will be in there every chance I get. Since I am the only employee in the business I started, it also means I set my own schedule and can choose to take on as much or as little work as I want depending on how busy I am in the studio. So I am confident I will be able to get everything done and hope to move to being a full-time artist when the time is right.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMzU5NTIyODU1","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":17,"number_of_comments_depth_all":0,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nI finally found a suitable studio space.

My work has also been recognized with awards by the National League of American Pen Women, the Fine Arts Society of Sarasota, Sarasota’s Education Foundation, at various juried art exhibitions, etc.\r\n\r\nI work every year with Art Fest Fort Myers. I have been involved with many aspects of this large downtown art festival. From working directly with the exhibiting artists to helping with the behind-the-scenes judging and scoring process for awards. They see me as an invaluable part of their operation each year and I always look for ways to make it better and run more smoothly. This experience helps me understand what it takes to be a part of a successful art community in downtown Bonita Springs.\r\n\r\nI also have my own small business that I started from the ground up. It doesn't make a lot of money (which is why I need Kickstarter for this!) but it has given me all of the business experience I need to run a successful studio/gallery. For example setting a schedule, keeping deadlines, accepting all forms of payment, accounting, advertising, etc. \r\n\r\nI graduated in 2008 from Stetson University with a major in marketing and a minor in fine art. I knew that combination would eventually help me become a successful artist.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Matt Kearney","creator_last_login":1558479672,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.upriverceramics.com","domain":"upriverceramics.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/010/961/816/b35556b4ff1a7ab4a01e079ec3e90e52_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461723232&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=40a68fb640f61202576bb895a81b98d8","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1313610585","top_cities_location_1st":"Fort Myers United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"4","top_cities_location_2st":"Naples United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"4","top_cities_location_3st":"Cape Coral United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"3","top_cities_location_4st":"Bradenton United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"2","top_cities_location_5st":"Sarasota United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"2","top_cities_location_6st":"Kitchener Canada","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Christiansted Virgin Islands, U.S.","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Berlin Germany","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Atlanta United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Benton United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"38","top_countries_location_2st":"Canada","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_countries_location_3st":"Germany","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_countries_location_4st":"Virgin Islands, U.S.","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","number_of_new_backers":32,"number_of_returning_backers":13}
