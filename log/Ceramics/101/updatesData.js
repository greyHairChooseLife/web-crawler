All of the rewards have been sent out as of a couple weeks ago. Only 3 more rewards are left here for a few people that chose to come pick them up in person so they could see the studio and gallery. I hope you've been following along on my <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/upriverceramics\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook group</a> and <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/upriverceramics\" target=\"_blank\">instagram page</a>. But if not, I'll give you one final update here with some pictures of the completed rewards along with a few other things that were made along the way. </p><p>I also want to announce that I have finally set up an <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/UpriverCeramics\" target=\"_blank\">Etsy shop</a>! So if you didn't get enough of what you wanted, check it out and get ready for holiday gift season. I am still working on adding even more pieces there, so make sure you check back now and then to see what else has been added. And please share it with anyone you can. Also don't forget that I will gladly take requests on custom pieces you want. </p><p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Second kiln batch all done\" data-caption=\"Second kiln batch all done\" data-id=\"14425219\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Second kiln batch all done\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/425/219/b7a7c4c7a1613c9a32fe7d845d7c56e7_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478542760&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=94c98724a46219213d7bd37020426777\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Second kiln batch all done</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"One of the newest (and already sold) rain drop pieces.\" data-caption=\"One of the newest (and already sold) rain drop pieces.\" data-id=\"14425232\">\n<figure class=\"page-anchor\" id=\"asset-14425232\">\n<div class=\"video-player\" data-video-url=\"https://v2.kickstarter.com/1667405375-yU55Ap091d6RRxQeXFYuqpVizOEzZQJlKZi0sGXZto8%3D/assets/014/425/232/4c0e846aaf6eedc8c7a0bc3e78d84099_h264_high.mp4\" data-image=\"https://d15chbti7ht62o.cloudfront.net/assets/014/425/232/4c0e846aaf6eedc8c7a0bc3e78d84099_h264_high.jpg?2016\" data-dimensions='{\"width\":640,\"height\":640}' data-context=\"Update\">\n<video class=\"portrait\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"https://v2.kickstarter.com/1667405375-yU55Ap091d6RRxQeXFYuqpVizOEzZQJlKZi0sGXZto8%3D/assets/014/425/232/4c0e846aaf6eedc8c7a0bc3e78d84099_h264_high.mp4\" type='video/mp4;

Since it is capable of reaching 2350 degrees fahrenheit, is located inside of my studio/gallery in a historic building, and will contain all of your rewards that have taken me months to make, I hope you'll understand that you can't be too careful. Oh, and did I mention it releases poisonous gases during the firing process??? Yeah. So I'm thoroughly reading all the manuals, safety brochures, and watching youtube instructional videos. I also need to have a fire inspector give her approval when it is all set up and ready too. Hopefully the test firings will start soon!</p><p>Thank you all for your patience.

All of your cups/mugs and tiles are done being made and ready to be fired. I'm now working on the water droplet pieces. I estimated July for the tiles and cups, but since today is August 1st, you probably realize I estimated too early. While these pieces are all relatively small, the detail and precision I put into them still takes a considerable amount of time. </p><p>But more than anything else, the delay is related to the kiln. I want to wait to fire it until I have enough pieces finished to fill it up. And since these are all relatively small, that means pretty much all the rewards will be finished before it is ready to be filled and fired. I also may need to do some test firings first since I have not used this kiln before. So while my estimates for shipping your rewards were a bit optimistic, you should know that they are all in progress. I have not worked on any other pieces besides the backer rewards either as they are my top priority. </p><p>In the category of \"possibly too much information,\" you should also know that my beloved grandmother who lived with and helped raise me passed away recently and I spent a week by her side to make sure she wouldn't be alone. So that also delayed the process but I'm sure you all understand that. </p><p>In other news, I had a chance to see my ceramics mentor for the first time in almost 10 years too. Korean Master Potter, <a href=\"http://www.kiwoonhuh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ki Woon Huh</a>, in Sarasota, FL. It was great to see all of his new work and to pick up a few pointers from him that I had forgotten over the years. He also gave me a few tools I needed and showed me how to make a few others I need. I've been out searching for and gathering bamboo and tree branches that are shaped just right to carve the tools needed. But it will be a long process for some of them. Check them out below.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"These are the tools he showed me that I need to make. They help with shaping larger pieces.

Your backer rewards will be made in front of lots of patriotic onlookers on Monday! And I'll also have the studio and gallery open for people to check out too of course. I'm pretty excited!

So far, I just have a few cups that have been thrown on the wheel. I'm getting the hang of it again after 10 years. The hardest part to re-figure out was centering the clay on the wheel.

You are all very generous and I'm looking forward to making and sending out your rewards! Don't forget that Kickstarter is an all or nothing format.
