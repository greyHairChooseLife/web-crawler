A Residency Program is an opportunity for artists to have uninterrupted time and space to create work. For me, it means being able to have the resources to create new sculptures and functional wares (pots) out of clay, which will help me build my portfolio, meet other artists, and creatively challenge myself, my work, and my peers. During my time there, which will be spent with four other amazing artists and dear friends of mine,  I will be provided with a studio, accommodation, and meals. The financial aid supplied by this Kickstarter project will go towards helping me pay for the fees involved with the program. </p><p>Simply put, residency programs are the bomb: they provide artists such as myself with the time, resources, and community to create contemporary and innovative new work. Not to mention the fact that I get to spend three weeks in one of the most beautiful places in Canada (find out more about the Banff Centre here -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.banffcentre.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.banffcentre.ca/</a>&nbsp;). Ontop of all of those great things, my fellow Resident Artists will be four hardworking and talented ceramic artists who inspire me and encourage me to take risks in my practice. So, whats not to like?&nbsp;As an emerging artist, it can be hard to break into a career where your work supports itself: the beginnings of an independent art practice involve long hours, day jobs, impressive piles of rejection letters, and overall perseverance. Oftentimes, that couple hundred bucks makes our goals and dreams that much more realistic - that small amount of support can be the game changer for opportunities and programs that we otherwise couldn't afford.&nbsp;</p><p>By pledging, you can not only help me to financially support the career that I love, but will allow me to foster my artistic community and practice. And, if you've gotten to this point, thanks so very much for reading, and especially for your time &nbsp;- I appreciate it more than I can say.</p><p>Best, and thanks again,&nbsp;</p><p>Jocelyn</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Let face it: we all know that there are misadventures when undertaking an arts-based project. Pieces explode in kilns (literally), pots crack, and sometimes it's just a matter of a sculpture not ending up the way I wanted it to. This project definitely has risks and challenges - there's always room for things to go wrong or not turn out. Regardless of those challenges and risks, I will inevitably come away from this program with new knowledge, new work, and another valuable learning experience.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":4,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">CA$ 20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 15</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>If you pledge $20, I will send you a handmade thank-you card (with an original drawing!) and high fives (with all my gratitude).</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only certain countries</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">CA$ 60</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 44</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>If you pledge $60, I will send you a small porcelain cup that has a drawing of a letter of the alphabet (your choice!) on it.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only certain countries</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n2 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (10 left of 12)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">CA$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 74</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>If you pledge $100 dollars, I'll send you a full-size porcelain mug with a really cool drawing on it.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only Canada</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (9 left of 9)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">CA$ 500</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 366</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>If you pledge $500 dollars, I'll send you a small original sculpture with a handmade thank you card (telling you how grateful I am!) included.
