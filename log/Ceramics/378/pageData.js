I strive to celebrate the fullness of flesh in an abstracted form so the public will unknowingly develop an appreciation for what they have been conditioned to dislike or feel self-conscious about. My hope is that my work will help all people understand their body's beauty of form and help spread a feeling of love.</p><p>(Unabridged) MY ARTIST STATEMENT:&nbsp;</p><p>My work observes the disparity between bodies that are socially regarded as unattractive, but are also artistically appealing in terms of their formal qualities.  I fell into this obsession when I was exposed to my first nude models, of all sizes, during freshman year.  It was obvious to me that the bodies which had beautifully swelled areas that collapsed into folds were much more enjoyable and inspiring to render than the bodies that were thin and angular.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Shortly after I began drawing these bodies, I began working with ceramics.  The physical density of the medium naturally conveys a visual weight.  I utilized this property in volumes, not exposing the actual thickness of the work.  I contrasted these ballooning volumes with grooves that quilt the body.  This creates an experience of tension through the lines and release through the expanse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceramics also has a certain tendency to acquire dimples when it is being hand built quickly.  These qualities allowed the viewer to assume the likeness of human flesh and cellulite.  In addition to the undulating clay surface, I applied a glaze that created a pore-like texture that was tinted a color close to my own Caucasian skin tones.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Engaging these qualities, I rely on the audience's ability to interpret the unspoken associations that are disclosed in my line, volume, and texture.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I utilize geometry's artificiality to infuse my work with a rigidity that is man made. I concentrated on circles and ovals because of their natural tautness and even distribution of that stress.  I purposely punctuated the perimeter to direct where the sensation of tension is channeled. I begin my sculptures with this circular boundary to exemplify the preconditioned world we are born into.  To allow the audience freedom to investigate my work, I hung my work on the wall to distance the sculpture from direct reality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Akin to Richard DeVore's vessels, I employ ceramics' history of being associated between the body and the earth.  I engage the curves and crevasses that are found on the body.  These tend to have a natural resemblance to the earthâ€™s topography.  This physical relationship is the only realm that humanity exists on. It is tethered by our senses and maintained by an understanding of our impact.  The forms I create describe the oppressive relationship of humanity to the world and humanity to itself.  They  linger between being identified fully with either subject, yet the surface treatment sways the resemblance towards human.</p><p>I strive for an elegance in my forms that overtake any immediate associations with the natural world. My work elicits a feeling of satisfaction and attraction, before the viewer can begin to make associations to their own body. Thus leaving the viewer with an experience of pleasure and confidence.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Minimal risk.
