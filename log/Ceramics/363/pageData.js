Disillusioned, bewildered and almost defeated by the challenges of being an artist in London, our vision was to create a sanctuary of sorts, a place where artists could just come and be for a bit, and have everything readily available to make new work should they wish, and others could come and learn and make.</p><p>In Dec 2015 we were able to purchase a Maison de Maître in France dating from the 1780’s and enveloped by countryside vistas. With much of the renovation of the building complete, we now have spaces to accommodate artists and other visitors.</p><p>Enthralled by the alchemy and healing properties of clay, whilst also aware of the difficulty for artists to access kilns and other necessary equipment, our first priority has always been to set up a fully-functioning, easy-to-use ceramics studio. We need your support to make it happen.</p><p>Some of the artist's associated with the Maison Salvadore are producing some very special rewards to enable you to support the project. You can see photographs of these on our website here - <a href=\"http://www.maisonsalvadore.com/?section=shop\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.maisonsalvadore.com/?section=shop</a></p><p>With just 1000 Euros we will be able to fabricate a basic wood-burning kiln; with 6000 Euros we will be able to purchase all of the materials and equipment we need to start hosting our first ceramic residencies and workshops in September 2016; with funds above this we can start setting up the molding, wood-working and metal workshops.</p><p>We have found a special corner of the world and we want to bring it to as many people as possible. Help us spread the word and bring the wonder of clay to as many artists and would-be makers as possible. </p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">We anticipate that not everyone who comes to use the space will have all of the knowledge and skills to use the equipment. We will have part-time technicians who will manage the space and generally be on hand for advice.\r\n\r\nWe know that some artists might need a fee to be able to complete the residency; we are therefore working with our prefecture to gain funding from the local commune to try and support this. We are also aware that transporting work back to artist’s country’s of residency is a concern, and have already built relationships with cross road carriers to make this safe and easy.\r\n\r\nWe promise to use your money to the best possible effect and keep you informed along the way. The Maison Salvadore has a large group of artists, curators and arts professionals associated with it that we refer to simply as the Friends of the Maison Salvadore. We have consulted with them and others to make sure that our plans are realistic and our budgeting fair, and to help us along over any bumps.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":12,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">€10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nThank you postcard\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>We will send you a handwritten, handmade thank you postcard dispatched directly from us in L’isle Jourdain, straight to you.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-07-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Jul 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">€15</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 15</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSpecially written prose\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>As we sip our morning coffee and look out over the Vienne, we will compose some prose specially to you.
