Last year, my husband and I decided to do something we had always talked about and move out to the country. This meant packing up our young family and my established studio of 15 years and moving into the home and studio of my dreams. The studio is twice the size of the old one and overlooks forest and the Ausable River ravine, positively idyllic. However, the building did require extensive renovation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"The new studio.\" data-id=\"30261154\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/261/154/14e1bb468f6c21d4fb7357adbd82da0a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1597855491&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=26d86e14dc3cca605d7ecd71774ec563\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The new studio.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>All this meant that I have been unable to make my own creative pottery work for about 18 months now. Artists talk about how the creative force wells up inside and seeks an outlet: it's true! I have been channeling my creativity into Art Journals, using collage, paint, pencil, ink, and text.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"One of many Art Journal pages I created while away from the pottery studio.\" data-id=\"30261410\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/261/410/1f91ce7692dfdbc3042ffb467b8556eb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1597856558&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7a8b39cecff0e160ab123b9404356fbd\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">One of many Art Journal pages I created while away from the pottery studio.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Now I am ready to translate those pages into clay! I decided that when I open the new studio I want to begin with something really special and I came up with the idea for the 100 Mugs Project. I am going to create a series of 100 mugs, each numbered, and embellished with imagery and text.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Here's a few of the first completed mugs.\" data-id=\"30443410\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/443/410/88ae5e352a95a066754b203a5aa52bd4_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1599042616&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=331d25457b28228fa3e1148e5c2ae727\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Here's a few of the first completed mugs.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This will be an extension of the pottery work and designs I've created over the years, yet more exquisitely detailed and unique. You can imagine each mug like a page from a book, together they tell a story: a story of hope and persistence, joy, love, beauty and so much more.</p>\n<p>When you pledge your support you will receive the mug number(s) in the order you pledged, but you will not choose your specific design. This allows me full creativity to complete the 100 Mugs Project from my own inspiration and to tell the story from my journals. You can trust that all the mugs will be similar in shape and colour palette as the ones you see here, as I am enamoured with white and light, bright colours. They will all have some imagery and some text.</p>\n<p>You also have the option to make a pledge for a class to make your own mug in my CLAY EXPERIENCE class. I will guide you through how to express yourself in clay <span class=\"text-italic\">and</span> make a functional mug. You can purchase the class as a gift to do with your family or friends. You can choose from the many dates I'll have lined up, or for a group of 6 you can set your own date.
