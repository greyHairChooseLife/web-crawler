I'll have more control over this, and will be able to tell for sure what is happening, and how I can avoid it. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Quick sneak peek of today's photoshoot, I haven't even retouched these yet\" data-caption=\"Quick sneak peek of today's photoshoot, I haven't even retouched these yet\" data-id=\"14065320\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Quick sneak peek of today's photoshoot, I haven't even retouched these yet\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/065/320/802bd611c3c9c1043ce200085ac541b1_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1476191341&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=57591ed60a13a60434114d626a3f2ade\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Quick sneak peek of today's photoshoot, I haven't even retouched these yet</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"cylinder &amp; vases\" data-caption=\"cylinder &amp; vases\" data-id=\"14065404\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"cylinder &amp; vases\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/065/404/ef2052d1876e18ffbede7ed440615d28_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1476191744&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=256ccaf5b3d24c19c8d1669abcababf9\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">cylinder &amp; vases</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"It's autumn.

As I was gleefully calling in to the BBK Studios to let them know I was dropping in as usual to fire my pieces, the studio assistant greeted me with news that felt like a dramatic dead end: I would not be able to fire my pieces, nor use the kiln for the next six weeks. She was going on holiday and the kiln was reserved for people who work on site during that time. Sure, change is good. Sudden, unexpected change not so much. What was I going to tell my Kickstarter backers?! How was I going to grow my business? When was I going to fire the myriad of cylinders currently mushrooming out of my studio?</h1><p>I spent the next two days in a typical loss of hope which precedes any significant progress. The wonderful thing with age is that I know the drill now: frustration leads to powerlessness leads to even-better-than-the-previous-solution solution. It takes me one or two days of what the french call <a href=\"http://www.expression-francaise.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/broyer_du_noir.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">\"broyer du noir\"</a>, which is essentially ruminating in frustration, before I springboard out and enter the solution-finding zone, and it usually involves some serendipitous twist-of fate. I made a list of the problems with the BBK Studios, imagined what my ideal progress would look like at this point and wrote down ideal future scenarios. I want to build a community of ceramicists around me, reach out to my fellow creators in Berlin, find a studio and a kiln I can rely on in a more intimate, on-the-premises kind of way.</p><p>It allowed me to continue building a map of ceramic resources in Berlin, plot my progress and ask for help (I feel useless at this, I'm learning that turns out most people are - a friend recently gave me a copy of Amanda Palmer's <a href=\"http://shop.amandapalmer.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Asking</a>). </p><p>I was rewarded with some wonderful emails and one in particular from Réjane at <a href=\"http://www.larecreation.de/#intro-la-recreation\" target=\"_blank\">La Récreation</a> who I will visit tomorrow, and with whom I'm hoping to collaborate from now on. </p><p>The good news is that I'm still making as much as possible on the wheel. 50+ pieces of greenware are dotted around my house. They're not fired, but they exists. The last week saw some big steps forward as I have also begun to contact places interested in selling my ceramics, thinking of a name for the business, planning the website, my personal evolution and beginning to outline what my collection might look like. I'm worried that I'm running before I can walk - without a kiln, a crucial step and lots of experience is missing. But I can't stand still and if I'm not firing them, then there are lots of other aspects to get on ahead with and consider. Now that I look back, it's been a crazy productive week propelling me forward and with a bit of luck, this time next week I will be firing all of these.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"This is around half of what I need to fire right now :/ Actually it will be strange having empty shelves again!\" data-caption=\"This is around half of what I need to fire right now :/ Actually it will be strange having empty shelves again!\" data-id=\"13619173\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"This is around half of what I need to fire right now :/ Actually it will be strange having empty shelves again!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/619/173/34271c6264fc5937a6705c1d6efcdcd6_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473172720&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ee5e6d220d89569d3c5cebb7106e9001\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">This is around half of what I need to fire right now :/ Actually it will be strange having empty shelves again!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"long cylinder and open vase I have been wanting to make, finished this weekend\" data-caption=\"long cylinder and open vase I have been wanting to make, finished this weekend\" data-id=\"13618421\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"long cylinder and open vase I have been wanting to make, finished this weekend\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/618/421/ca45b8b84d44fba3439a5345410b8bad_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473168677&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b16c084908c7f1b5053f3f631e2d58f2\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">long cylinder and open vase I have been wanting to make, finished this weekend</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"This vase is the biggest I have made so far - and is going as part of the future collection designs\" data-caption=\"This vase is the biggest I have made so far - and is going as part of the future collection designs\" data-id=\"13618487\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"This vase is the biggest I have made so far - and is going as part of the future collection designs\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/618/487/63116e34efb6843e6338cd67baef1273_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473169056&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=0b68fb405b19700d65e6b1e888712b51\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">This vase is the biggest I have made so far - and is going as part of the future collection designs</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Keeping sketches of the shapes I like for a future collection\" data-caption=\"Keeping sketches of the shapes I like for a future collection\" data-id=\"13618501\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Keeping sketches of the shapes I like for a future collection\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/618/501/a28589b43fc225856af251899100b1a7_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473169164&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=db4a82d029696f5878d237c69ea77830\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Keeping sketches of the shapes I like for a future collection</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"13618527\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/618/527/93e30b0ec98439f6f2d5b499913834d1_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473169298&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=83a7c2f111b449b424510f8716775673\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1472562675,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE2NjgxMTI=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Kiln Time & Test Gradients","publishedAt":1472562675,"pinnedAt":null,"number":21,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Maïa","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/054/978/8248c037ab35128a6eeb8f4fa05db33a_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461363602&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1beb8871f38b3fa5a3a5011ef9a4a9a6","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":2,"commentsCount":1,"body":"<p>I'm back in the studio and having trouble keeping up with all that needs to be done!</p><p>The cylinders and vases go into the bisque firing this week, much needed as I now have over 40 pieces in the studio which I need to safely schlep down to the kiln now. That's including the 10 large cylinders I made the week before last. </p><p>This weekend I decided that I really needed 11 small test-cylinders to find the right firing temperature for the glaze firing. Since these are a mix of clays, I need to find the right glaze and temperature and hopefully I'll also find the body colour I'm after; I'd like a warm, medium orange/pink. So I made 200g batches starting at 100% stoneware and changing the mix by 20g each time until I reached 100% terracotta. </p><p>The difficulty here is that the stoneware gets fired ideally between 1220° and 1250° and the terracotta goes up to a max of 1190° - so not necessarily an ideal combo, but I want the strength and plasticity of the stoneware and the earthiness of the terracotta. I imagine I'll split them into two firing temperatures and see what gives me the best results with a view to colour, porosity, and plasticity. It also depends on the glazes since I'm going to use just plain white and I'm not mixing my own yet, so I have to fire at the glaze's optimal firing temperature. So many parameters to consider.</p><p>Thanks to all of you who have received your cylinders and are sending me sweet messages, I'm happy you like them!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Some of the large cylinders, all in the stoneware clay\" data-caption=\"Some of the large cylinders, all in the stoneware clay\" data-id=\"13542801\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Some of the large cylinders, all in the stoneware clay\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/542/801/51aa1f915c50bfcac38932dbd9499c3d_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1472562095&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=43326ed0db996b55f17b42aec45e1558\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Some of the large cylinders, all in the stoneware clay</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A vase I made over the weekend, been wanting to try this shape out for ages.\" data-caption=\"A vase I made over the weekend, been wanting to try this shape out for ages.\" data-id=\"13542805\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A vase I made over the weekend, been wanting to try this shape out for ages.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/542/805/6f5fdbb4bfd517377cddf10c5ae68a71_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1472562123&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=fe981c216ebee5013f4474d508870555\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A vase I made over the weekend, been wanting to try this shape out for ages.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"This large bowl was thrown with the same amount of clay as the large cylinders - 600g - I managed to make it incredibly thin, it's so light!\" data-caption=\"This large bowl was thrown with the same amount of clay as the large cylinders - 600g - I managed to make it incredibly thin, it's so light!\" data-id=\"13542812\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"This large bowl was thrown with the same amount of clay as the large cylinders - 600g - I managed to make it incredibly thin, it's so light!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/542/812/116d4c6c3baf3b81aa2751086bb9509f_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1472562167&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=f7a9ceca16289f1d06e2eda2e4a36d16\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">This large bowl was thrown with the same amount of clay as the large cylinders - 600g - I managed to make it incredibly thin, it's so light!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"200gr lumps of mixed clay for colour tests, weighed, wedged, and ready for throwing.\" data-caption=\"200gr lumps of mixed clay for colour tests, weighed, wedged, and ready for throwing.\" data-id=\"13542822\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"200gr lumps of mixed clay for colour tests, weighed, wedged, and ready for throwing.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/542/822/10c2201850b76117d446044f3839e030_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1472562242&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=9cfd29ea711314bff9f9614565bf934e\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">200gr lumps of mixed clay for colour tests, weighed, wedged, and ready for throwing.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The small cylinders for the colour tests are dry and will go into the bisque firing with the other pieces this week!

So, onwards and upwards.</b></p><h1 id=\"h:the-verdict\" class=\"page-anchor\">The verdict</h1><p>Sure the cups make nice little sugar bowls or paperclip holders, but they are not suitable for holding liquids. I have been testing them for a week and not only do they become slightly damp from the liquids they hold, the transparent glaze seems to release a yellow hue that stains the clay. Porosity can be a good thing; it was used to keep drinks and food cold in the olden days, and who knows I might use this in the future. Nothing's ever lost yet it doesn't suit our purposes here so it's back to the wheel and back to popping out cylinders!  </p><h1 id=\"h:what-does-this-mean\" class=\"page-anchor\">What does this mean for my backers?</h1><p>I have to ask for your patience as I have decided to make a new set of cylinders to replace these and fire them to the highest kiln temp available in the studio: 1250°C. On the bright side, I'm now very comfortable with the process of making cylinders so I'm hoping to blast through these - but not without proper testing first; new clay, new firing temperature, new glaze. I will limit the variables and work up from there.</p><h1 id=\"h:how-long-are-we-talk\" class=\"page-anchor\">How long are we talking?</h1><p>I can't say for sure, but I'm now aiming for June.

Of course you will all be kept informed via updates. </p><h1 id=\"h:the-upshot-for-you\" class=\"page-anchor\">The upshot for you</h1><p>You will all receive pieces made to a certain standard of quality, I have so much more experience at the wheel by now.

I cannot thank you enough for your encouragement and support through the project, unexpected setbacks are exactly that; surprising and readjusting and absolutely necessary. </p><h1 id=\"h:the-upshot-for-me\" class=\"page-anchor\">The upshot for me</h1><p>I have learnt quite a lot and this is all still great practice.

For a clay to become as non-porous as possible, which is what we want when making dinnerware, you have to fire it to its vitrification temperature; the temperature at which it hardens and tightens and its particles fuse, more like glass. Although the kilns at the studio won't allow me to go much beyond 1200°, I was still well under that as the glazes I used fire at around 1080°C. This means that the pieces are all still somewhat porous, and they do stain. </p><p>I'm only a little ok with this. The learning curve is steep, and I'm on my own. I'm user-testing the pieces, and they are lovely to use and hold, but I'm disappointed that the parts that aren't glazed will stain. I still have a bunch of rewards to make and the clay I am now using fires to 1300°, so I will probably find a good high-fire glaze and work on getting this fired to the highest temp I can. For those of you who receive low-fire pieces; they are beautiful, and will get their share of patina, which I'm also ok with! </p><p>Thank you all, and some pretty picture from the pieces coming soon.</p><p>Regards from an almost wintery Berlin, Maia</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1460884960,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE1NDk4MTg=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Fire!","publishedAt":1460884960,"pinnedAt":null,"number":11,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Maïa","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/054/978/8248c037ab35128a6eeb8f4fa05db33a_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461363602&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1beb8871f38b3fa5a3a5011ef9a4a9a6","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":6,"commentsCount":3,"body":"<p>On Friday morning I packed about 50 pieces and brought them to the ceramic studios for their glaze firing.

It will be quite interesting to see the results as I tried various glaze combos. I don't think I took any risks, but enough for the anticipation to be exciting.

Once I get these back from the kiln, I will send out the surveys, which will ask you to confirm your shipping address and any other questions I might have.
