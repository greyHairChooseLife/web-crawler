I will not ship any piece I am not happy with at the stage it was made, and will redo anything with serious defects that aren't good enough until I have 100 I am happy with. I do rely on your indulgence though, chances are what you receive won't be perfect these are my first 100 pieces. Ever.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">What will your piece look like?</span></p>\n<p>Ceramics. The entire process is like a child's birthday party crashes into buddhism; lots of anticipation, repeated surprises, and the constant practice of being in the now and letting go. Basically: no one knows until I ship it, so have faith. What we <i>do</i> know is: it will be in the reward category of your choice - cylinder, pair of cups, or vase. Due to the fact I'm making a hundred different pieces with various clays and glazes, I'm unable to take requests for shape and or colour!!</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"cylinder on the left and two vases in the front - not fired or glazed yet but aren't they lovely at this stage?!\" data-caption=\"cylinder on the left and two vases in the front - not fired or glazed yet but aren't they lovely at this stage?!\" data-id=\"5242079\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"cylinder on the left and two vases in the front - not fired or glazed yet but aren't they lovely at this stage?!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/242/079/ad0c9f4abbc86457193a5399447b46b5_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1453674180&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=502458a9813306727ea1f3a9ad5eff47\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">cylinder on the left and two vases in the front - not fired or glazed yet but aren't they lovely at this stage?!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Another vase before firing\" data-caption=\"Another vase before firing\" data-id=\"5242041\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Another vase before firing\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/242/041/53aef0e0bd7bda9bc9a4418134c2124c_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1453673800&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=aeb26b43ce48842f2012b329d2797f04\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Another vase before firing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"a whole bunch of cylinders and vases at different stages - greenware and bisque awaiting the glazing\" data-caption=\"a whole bunch of cylinders and vases at different stages - greenware and bisque awaiting the glazing\" data-id=\"5242062\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"a whole bunch of cylinders and vases at different stages - greenware and bisque awaiting the glazing\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/242/062/dfe6f01957642074296da08e4705c2e9_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1453674009&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6c34b047c371e0a381c893b08acc9a30\" data-airgap-id=\"33\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">a whole bunch of cylinders and vases at different stages - greenware and bisque awaiting the glazing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><span class=\"bold\">What's next in the studio?</span></p>\n<p>I have made this quite sharp career shift and I couldn't be happier.

But some challenge would slow me down considerably. \r\n\r\nThe biggest realistic challenge would be to injure my hands or arms in any way. In which case I would get back to the wheel in a couple of months when they are healed and finish the project. Other risks are that the local ceramic shop runs out of clay or glaze but that's even less likely than me losing my hands (ok this is getting grim now). \r\n\r\nA serious obstacle would be for the wheel to break down, I'd have to take time out to fix it - and if it can't be fixed, then I would use the money from the Kickstarter to buy another wheel instead of materials for upcoming projects. This would slow me down in being able to make more ceramic wares in the short term, but you would still get your rewards, as the first thing I would do with the new wheel is to get back to making those 100 cylinders!</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0yMDMwNDE1ODA4","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":32,"number_of_comments_depth_all":8,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nI am making 100 clay cylinders.
