Pita Vazquez was born with the gift of craftsmanship in a small town called La Palma, located between the mountains of Sierra de los Organos, Cuba. He began creating beautiful masterpieces since he was just 5 years old. At the age of 12, Jose signed up for La Casa de Cultura in his hometown. After only a few gallery shows he became famous, nationally known, especially after his show \"Juguetes De Barro\", which gave him awards such as \"Pioneros Por el Arte\" in 2000-2001 in Pinar Del Rio. Jose joined The Art Instructors School Federico Engels in Pinar De Rio (Escuela Instructores de Arte Federico Engels de Pinar del Rio) studying visual arts and sculpture. He then graduated with honors in 2005 with Bachelors in Fine Arts and Humanities.\r\nJose moved to United States in 2006 with his family in search of the American Dream. Since then, he hasn't left school or his art. In 2007 through 2009 he was enrolled at the Southwest Florida College in Fort Myers, Florida where he graduated with an Associate in Graphic Design. In 2017, he graduated from the Miami International University of Art and Design with a Masters Degree  in  Fine Arts.\r\n\"I remember how I would exchange the soccer ball or the baseball bat for that mud formed in the puddles of rainy days.
