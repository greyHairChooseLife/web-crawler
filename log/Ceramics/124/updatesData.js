This is two-fold, I needed to order more supplies such as mason stains, which are used for making a colored clay slip that some of the designs require. I just recently received those colors in the mail. Its okay really, these products are coming from ceramic suppliers, not Amazon. The reality is we still have shortages and backorders, on top of shipping times, so sometimes it just takes a while. </p>\n<p>The second delay is due to waiting for the actual transfers. This one is on me. Since I put in a large order for several colors, all of the sheets were custom printed in sets, which delayed shipping by a few weeks. </p>\n<p><strong>Good news #2: </strong>The order for the underglaze designs has shipped as of today! Which means I should have all the necessary items this week to finalize underglaze tests. It will take me another 10 days or so after receiving everything to make a few \"color combo\" swatches to completion, but once that is done, I'll be set to finish up photo shoots, make the survey, and start sending those surveys out for you to choose your designs!</p>\n<br>\n<p>Now... for something totally exciting and unexpected that is going to help me make some of the Kickstarter items get made faster... </p>\n<h1 id=\"h:i-bought-a-slabrolle\" class=\"page-anchor\">I bought a slabroller!</h1>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Slab roller!!\" data-id=\"37503558\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/558/ddc35a0e3da7ccb925027d0482299997_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654057604&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e3e9a39095b054c4c27bd8d68f308b59\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Slab roller!!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This baby is another key piece of studio equipment that I use to make all of my slab pieces (plates, bread pans, and much much more). Without this, I'd have to use rolling pins, and let me tell you... that's a lot of wrist work, and I'm trying to preserve mine. </p>\n<p>The benefit of a slab roller aside from speed of making slabs, is that I'm able to keep my clay at a specific and even thickness. This is part of what helps my plates be so easily stackable (that and a few molds to help form the shape consistently). </p>\n<p>As you can also see in this photo, I've added a bunch of shelving. Another thing that I needed so I could actually move all of the glaze buckets and clay into the studio and really start making things. At the moment, things are very functional, and while much needs to be done, its good enough to sit down and start work. I'll share a studio tour in the next update. </p>\n<br>\n<p>Until then, take care and be well!</p>\n<p>-Stephanie</p>\n<br>\n<p>P.S. If you want a longer dive into the glaze testing process... continue reading on below. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Make a whole bunch of test tiles. </p>\n<p>These are made by throwing a bottomless ring on the wheel. When the clay is leather hard (hard, but still pliable and easy to work with), it gets cut into several small tiles with a foot so they can stand alone. The top of the tiles are marked with lines so that I can see how a glaze works over a textured surface. Then in each tile I carve out a hole so that the tiles can be hung on a string or something later. I've learned that this step actually takes several days (throwing, waiting to dry some, carving/cutting, etc...).</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"37503607\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/607/0d9fb17845a2ca887fd77e4e4ec57e57_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654058001&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9d9e79dc84a55ae23e4dd9608b1dbb51\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Fire the bone dry tiles in a bisque firing. </p>\n<p>This is the first step to firing any piece of ceramic ware. In basic terms, the bisque fire vitrifies the clay into a body that can be glazed. Running a bisque firing takes about 36 hours including the cooldown period. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Greenware loaded in for bisque firing. \" data-id=\"37503628\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/628/7766f7a92da69bcc66f70593bbcbf80f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654058203&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6ae23e99a8fedd92cc5b4462d6ea3c3f\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Greenware loaded in for bisque firing. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Unload the tiles and glaze each one. </p>\n<p>Double dips - one full dip and then a second dip for just the top half of the tile. This allows you to observe how one coat of glaze works, and what two glaze coats look like. You can test single colors, but also mix and match glazes to test combinations. I did a little bit of both. I actually tested 5 different clay bodies, with each clay making 25 tiles for a total of 125 tiles. I mostly wanted to test each individual color, but I did a few combos that I was familiar with to see how they'd come out. This step is really important because it helps you identify any errors in the glaze or firing before moving on to actual pieces.  This step takes a bit to sort the tiles and get them ready for dipping. I had carved the name of each glaze into the bottom of the tile so I'd know which was which. Once they were sorted, I could grab them in sets of 5, mix up a glaze, dip... and then rinse and repeat. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Glaze tiles before firing...\" data-id=\"37503672\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/672/1f6a0607764e393b68721e21cc362c4a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654058588&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=12a999bc9ee141aa9fbdefcb16910fb4\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Glaze tiles before firing...</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Glaze fire! </p>\n<p>The glaze fire is to a hotter temperature than the bisque firing, it fully develops the clay body and sets the glaze on the piece. This also takes about 36 hours with cooldown time. I don't like to rush opening glaze kilns either and always wait until the temps are back below 150F. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Glaze tiles after firing.\" data-id=\"37503677\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/677/8285b80f5486f382cb700a5530917869_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654058628&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c2219f838bd650391877dda42613d12a\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Glaze tiles after firing.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Now there is also this little thing I'd like to point out... the below little setup is how you test the temperature inside the kiln to make sure it is heating properly.  Yes, there is a thermometer and I can always see the temp, but what's important is how the clay bodies are receiving that heat. To test this, I use three different cones which are little pieces of pottery that help potters evaluate if their kiln has reached the correct temperature. I fire my ceramics to cone 6. The cone on the far right is cone 5, which melts at a lower temp than cone 6, and should look very \"melted\" during a firing. In the middle is the cone 6 piece, which should bend just so that the tip touches (as in this photo). The cone on the far left is a guard cone, which would melt at a higher temp than cone 6. So... if the guard cone looks like the middle or the right cone... you know you're firing too hot. If the cone on the right isn't melted,  you're firing too cool. Neat huh? For my firing... this looks great!</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Testing cones!\" data-id=\"37503682\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/682/356959b93bdd8b6c3b5478e2730f5074_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654058663&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=14ccd0503c79ede59703bc5a83aeb98b\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Testing cones!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Unload, sort, and inspect the tiles. </p>\n<p>This step is important as each glaze will look different on each clay body. I wanted to see which clays responded best with which glazes. Also to see if some glazes didn't come out with the expected color, opacity, and if there are any flaws such as running, crackling, glaze jumping off tiles... and so on. Thankfully most of the glazes I made up came out great, though there were a few that will need to go through troubleshooting. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"37503756\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/756/62541d3b04787d546dea63abe844f81d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654059541&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e53549248f960df2f2139c3ce8a6d5dd\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"37503758\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/503/758/d88f6082d8932014e73ef176b910978a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1654059555&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d02f5dd50620baccdd0236a75569b6ff\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>You might be able to see that the glazes can look a little different based on the clay body.

But, 2 hours driving back and forth to Lowe's, 3 hours hanging around the store, and 3 employees later, we were able to find the chosen flooring. Nothing to Lowe's fault, usually this was a special order floor color (unawares to me), but it just so happened a job was cancelled and the flooring was in stock, in a random location. Regardless, it was a win, and we came home with some nice waterproof vinyl. Knocked this floor out in about 5 hours. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Step 1: Figure out which direction looks best. \" data-id=\"36215858\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/215/858/f4a75f6d0fb6dafc25a7b55c925b642c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1643593050&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=427c4f2de120fc9c65d261d307acc877\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Step 1: Figure out which direction looks best. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Step 2: find your groove in locking those boards in. \" data-id=\"36215864\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/215/864/c0eb7628d0e3d1db26f7a65171f41695_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1643593100&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=95df75d6e24d437e0cbfdf5f5cc1234e\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Step 2: find your groove in locking those boards in. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Step 3: Gloriousness.\" data-id=\"36215868\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/215/868/17cba4bd7cb52d280e66a4f0a5ce4bb4_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1643593131&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d1f4dc9538367bebacefdc480c7f5db3\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Step 3: Gloriousness.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Drywall was up next, and we caught a break on getting some progress in because the <strong>impending snow storm was going to delay kiln delivery until the 20th</strong>.

The kiln will hopefully be arriving by the end of the month, but I don't have a firm date on delivery as of yet. Since the kiln is built to order, and supply chain can be a bit messy, there could always be a delay. I ordered the kiln from a ceramic shop in Richmond, VA. Once they get it in, they will also need to fit me into their schedule for delivery and installation. </p>\n<p>I knew that it could take a while for this bit, which is why I built my delivery timeline so far out into April of 2022. In the meantime, I am still awaiting the door and window delivery. Until those pieces are received, we won't be able to finish the siding. This is purely because we're not sure how the trim looks like for the door and windows. </p>\n<p>Now, while we wait on THOSE bits, I'm now working out what I want the interior to look like. I've been doing a lot of research on the appropriate flooring, and think I've selected some waterproof vinyl flooring that will work. I'm also building lists of the materials I'll need for making and glazing everyone's pieces. </p>\n<p>For the glaze, I want to provide everyone with the color options when I send out the reward surveys, and I really think it will be best to wait and do proper glaze testing with the new kiln. This is mainly because I don't want to test out glazes at the YMCA studio since those kilns are entirely different, and tend to fire to a slightly lower temperature, which means the glazes could look a bit different. All this means is that I'll have to wait a bit longer to share the color options. </p>\n<p>I can say that there will definitely be some of my traditional glaze combos which includes the matte pastel colors, some stacked blue colors, greenish-yellow, but I hope to add a few new ones to the mix! I will also need to test the colored clay slip for the non-carved pieces. The mason stains which I use to color the clay slip could also come out a bit differently between the two kilns. I just want to make sure that I have accurate color combos to share. </p>\n<p>While everything is in a sort of holding pattern now, I expect things to start moving rather quickly once pieces start to arrive. I will keep updating through the process, and please always feel free to reach out if you have any questions!</p>\n<br>\n<p>Be well and take care of yourselves!</p>\n<p>-Stephanie</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1637366900,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"7100.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"8028.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":58,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1637335236,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMzNjUwMDU=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"CELEBRATION TIME!!

Thank you all SO MUCH! The last few days were full of a ton of support from all over the place! People sharing my work to their network, or posting on all forms of social media, some places not even expected (hello Imgurians). However you came to find me and my work, thank you so much for being here, and for your support to get this studio finished up. I can't believe that we made the funding goal! </p>\n<p>I just wanted to send out a quick celebratory note to everyone, and once the Kickstarter officially ends tonight, I'll send out a more detailed message covering \"what's next\". The funding is just the start, we still have a ways to go - and being a backer, I'll keep you in the loop with regular updates on the studio build, kiln installation, and of course, all of the reward goodness. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"35635189\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/035/635/189/4fa316ab3117b375723378ddc2d16670_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1637335207&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e2bb1db6b5aad3e91a43fedcbf157bcf\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>-Stephanie</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1636304322,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMzNTMzMzY=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Just over two weeks in, and I'm almost halfway there thanks to all of you!","publishedAt":1636304322,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Stephanie Duston","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/034/596/383/5083feeb97313f3cfc21b2f6ee0ca970_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1629522778&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=8d57640b28c083a421c44bb99a4621c4","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Hello Everyone, </p>\n<p>I'm away this week in Salt Lake City for a soil conference, but wanted to take a moment to send another update and thank everyone for their pledges to back this project. Winter is coming up very fast in Virginia, so that means I need to get the space enclosed as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>This past week some electricians came out to set up some of the basic electrical needs to fuel the studio. I did include some extra funds in this Kickstarter to help with the cost of the electrical parts and installation work for getting the kiln up and running, but I still needed a whole bunch of other electrical work done first.  I now have outlets for general power, and some receptacles for lighting the space. Once the inside is complete, the electricians will be out to finish the work - probably in another month or so. </p>\n<p>One thing I have not shared, is that I have already put in a request for a kiln to be ordered. Since there was a huge backlog it made sense to make the request early, prior to the Kickstarter, so that I wouldn't have to wait another 12 weeks after everything was finalized here. Bold move and risky, I know, as I'll have to pay for that kiln soon after this completes. But I'm confident that we'll reach our funding goal in the next few weeks! The middle is always a bit slow going. The other reason I wanted to order the kiln in advance is so that I could deliver rewards sooner than later. If we were waiting 12 weeks after the Kickstarter to even get the kiln, then I wouldn't be able to get your rewards out the door until the middle of next year instead of in April. </p>\n<p>All of that said, here is my current timeline: </p>\n<p>November: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Finish installing the siding</li>\n  <li>Install doors and windows</li>\n  <li>Start work on finishing the interior </li>\n  <li>Keep promoting the Kickstarter fundraising!
