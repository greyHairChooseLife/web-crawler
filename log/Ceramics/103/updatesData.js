Not only can it be found in particles and waves (material) but it can be found in non-material things as well, such as thoughts, emotions, human behavior and personal patterns. What if Sacred Geometry could help us unlock the mysteries of human consciousness? What if we could use it to heal ourselves? What if we could use it to overcome personal obstacles and even accomplish goals? I'm, here to say that not only is it possible but my life is living proof of it. My goal is to bring large concepts down to earth in easy to understand ways and make \"the big picture\" tangible. My intention is to simplify Sacred Geometry as well as show people how there is a very human side and an everyday practical use to it all. I hope you'll join me on my next journey.
