I’m Annie. I’m an artist living in Boston with my two ferrets and a cat, and just recently I’ve really started to go down the road of a serious artist. It has always been difficult for me, as I am disabled by severe chronic migraines and the myriad problems they present. I used to suffer about 20 a month,which made it impossible to work and difficult to continue my art, causing the depression often brought on by constant migraines worse. For many years, I was without help or relief as I tried treatment after treatment.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24631391\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/631/391/bac82cba32bd3b4b23326bab16e2fa86_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1554222223&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2f152a80b9368febffcc2bb3a00fc021\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;But as of last year, I started a promising new drug therapy that has been helping me begin to live my life again! I wasn’t cured by a long shot, but it was just enough to let me be an artist again, and I am absolutely giddy to share my passions with the world. I joined a ceramics studio as soon as I could, and began working like a madwoman to re-train my muscles and mind, a slow but rewarding process I was eager to start.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24631376\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/631/376/6c9a4d681a7d96fb49f480dcd069284b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1554222186&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9064155f4e5abd40c7bdc43a56c5053b\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>One of the first things I created was a beautiful blue bear, whom I adored and who captured the hearts of many. People would comment to me that they loved seeing them, that they gave them a little warm piece of happiness, and it was true for me as well. I made a few more, and settled on the shape that was the most beloved: soft, stylized, rounded without losing the form of a bear, and absolutely touchable. I made them a vibrant blue because it is the most soothing and peaceful of all, the color of sky and sea, and my personal favorite.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24631399\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/631/399/ad8375ca5a66044d84ada2cc792ffa0c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1554222274&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=68fef9f593611c455d8c0a2da9f89c04\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>My only regular income is my Social Security, of which the studio fee takes a whopping 50% every other month. My Kickstarter goal is to share my happy little bears with the world, and earn enough to be able to not worry about the studio fee for 6 months. This would be a great boon to me, letting me put more towards my artistic career and build a professional portfolio! And if these bears are as loved by the community as I hope they will be, I would love to do something unique like this again.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24631423\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/631/423/e5b9fd0d4f9d49c9954e3c065ff76327_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1554222379&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a5b043046f1988ea4081fd14bb7237e6\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The best part about this project is that it is already complete! I made 40 blue bears and 10 baby bears all in advance of starting this, wanting to make sure they were ready to ship as soon as the campaign ended. I won’t lie, I will miss them; they are an adorable bunch as you will see in the photos. But I sincerely hope each one leaves, and makes someone’s life just a little warmer.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"24631435\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/631/435/f684a03ac15dc791c1f40121606f8264_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1554222427&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8dd5873f25585798331549d961b8974e\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Each bear is completely handmade by me, sculpted individually from a brown-speckle clay and shaped into the happy form you see now.
