I apologize for not posting an update sooner. You all helped make this Kickstarter a success, but I should be transparent and also share its failures with you. But to be sure, these failures <i>are</i> temporary — <b>you <i>will</i> get your mugs!</b> Just a little behind the original schedule. Sorry about that.</p><p>As an inexperienced ceramicist, I have had a dickens of a time getting the glaze to act the way that I wanted it to, and this has delayed me quite a bit. At first, the black overglaze didn't crack enough, and then it cracked too much (making it uncomfortable to hold), I had trouble getting the base colors to mix the way that I wanted them to, and I had serious crawling issues inside the mugs. The more experienced people I was calling on for help hadn't worked with some of these particular combinations, so while they were able to nudge me in the right direction, I just had to experiment. I did get some mugs done for the party I threw at my house, but the glaze was still not where I wanted it to be. I knew I could do better, and I wanted to make them the best I could for you.</p><p>Thankfully, I can now report that the Lava glaze is 95% of where I want it to be:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Pele lava glaze\" data-caption=\"Pele lava glaze\" data-id=\"18628347\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pele lava glaze\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/018/628/347/c1ea4befc507dcaaca3ed0265eaa91d6_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1507253527&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b1bc8fcae1f282b9b58cd5e8bcd961dc\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pele lava glaze</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I am going to do a couple of more test firings this weekend to see if I can get that final 5%, and then I plan to quickly ramp up, averaging 10 mugs per week until I get them all done and shipped out to you. You will start receiving them in October and November, and into December, when I hope to have all of them finished. I will also send a message to you to let you know when your specific mug is going into the kiln and when yours ships.</p><p>The \"Wood\" glaze is still a work in process to get it to look how I originally envisioned, but I will also post a larger update once that is finalized. In light of this, if you backed for both Wood and Lava, your Lava mug may ship first. Please let me know if you prefer to wait for both to ship together.</p><p>I sincerely apologize for not keeping you updated in September, but I will make sure you know what's happening from here on out. Thank you for making this project possible, and for bearing with my learning curve! If you have any questions at all about your mug(s), please do message me here on Kickstarter.</p><p>PS: Here are the beautiful letterpress coasters that will ship with every mug, designed by my good friend Michael Gower.

I designed a 3D model of the Kilauea Cove logo and some other text.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"3D model of the logo for the base of the mug.\" data-caption=\"3D model of the logo for the base of the mug.\" data-id=\"17520224\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"3D model of the logo for the base of the mug.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/520/224/89bda89f101d64e3d18942f41cc81a3e_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1500143138&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=764473b89eb3615c42b87a3ee76fb8ec\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">3D model of the logo for the base of the mug.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>I then used a 3D printer to print a dimensional version of that model, and embedded that in the base of the mug. I have an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FDM printer</a>, which stands for Fused Deposition Modeling — basically it melts thin filaments of plastic and draws a layer at a time, building up the layers vertically. When you 3D-print this way, you end up with small ridges on the side of the model that are a little rough (at least on my printer), and would have made it hard to mold cleanly, so I used a resin called XTC-3D to help smooth out the edges and blend it into the base of the mug — which is why it looks so shiny in this photo:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Logo embedded in the base of the mug\" data-caption=\"Logo embedded in the base of the mug\" data-id=\"17520270\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Logo embedded in the base of the mug\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/520/270/b474584bdef21c96cc015f2cf32d3ec3_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1500143479&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5b997291ace5372dd4f289e109f279ce\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Logo embedded in the base of the mug</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p> After that, I popped off the front piece of the mold, covering the Pele figure, to see how the sour cream plaster had fared. It was surprisingly not bad! But I decided to re-pour it anyway, to avoid having to clean up a few small bubbles, and make the mold surface cleaner. The original sculpt wasn't damaged from the mold, and required minimal clean-up to prepare for the re-mold.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Pele right before the re-mold of the front piece\" data-caption=\"Pele right before the re-mold of the front piece\" data-id=\"17520294\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pele right before the re-mold of the front piece\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/520/294/c9f3204fb14d9e92908ac818af22fbb1_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1500143639&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7d77eb0d81468655ef80cc23868798cb\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pele right before the re-mold of the front piece</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p> After a little clean up, here's the entire finished mold!
