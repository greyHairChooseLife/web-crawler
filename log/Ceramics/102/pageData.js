I've been into it since somewhere around 2005 when I fell into a rathole, researching the history of it, and finding a community that was as passionate about it as I was starting to be. I swore one day I would have a tiki bar in my basement, with its own tiki mug.</p><p>Flash forward twelve years, and I've finally started making the things I've always wanted to make. Last year I built <span class=\"bold\">Kilauea Cove</span> — a small tiki bar in my basement, with an active volcano, carved trim, and custom shelves. You may have seen the volcano eruption video, if you read <a href=\"https://news.critiki.com/2017/04/25/how-to-build-a-volcano-raspberry-pi-style/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Critiki</a>:</p><div class=\"text-center clip mb5\"><div class=\"my-6\"><div class=\"embedly-card\"><div class=\"embedly-card-hug\" style=\"width: 100%; padding: 0px; position: relative; min-width: 200px; margin: 5px auto;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" id=\"emb_33t1km\" class=\"embedly-card\" style=\"border: none; position: relative; visibility: visible; display: block; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%; min-width: 200px;\" height=\"288\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div></div></div></div>\n\n\n<p>I've also been learning to sculpt — making Vulcan ears and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSJtssZhGAY/?taken-by=vixenlabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Borg implants</a> for my friends’ cosplay.</p><p>With the encouragement and advice of Jen Essex, Humuhumu Trott, Wendy Cevola, and Tim Wood, I've been learning learning the steps to make my own tiki mugs. Practicing the techniques needed to make a tiki mug, I sculpted and cast a unique set of sea turtle medallions.</p><p>Now I'm ready to make the first official tiki mug for Kilauea Cove.&nbsp;With your help, I can bring this mug to life!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have tried to research this as thoroughly as I can, but there may be unforeseen complications, and my time estimates may be off. I have never cast this many clay items before, nor have I used this glaze combination before. The glazes may not come out exactly as envisioned in the artist’s concepts.\r\n\r\nTo counter this I have tested smaller scale slip-casting projects, from which I learned a lot. I am making glaze tests on individual mug casts before I go into production. I have skilled ceramicists I can call on for advice should anything go wrong. If the schedule slips, mugs intended for party attendees will be completed first, but mugs will remain numbered according to your backer number.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0zODgyNTA3OTY=","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":25,"number_of_comments_depth_all":51,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nPele — A limited-edition original tiki mug from Seattle’s Kilauea Cove.
