I'm raising money for a small electric kiln. At this time the pandemic has made access to ceramic resources and functional studio space limited due to distance or price. I'm applying for grad school and having kiln access would allow me to create work up to and through school. A kiln would also allow for a start up studio in my current town, making ceramics and pottery more accessible locally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Coffee is important to me because it allows me to connect with people and places. By helping to fund my project I'll be creating and sending you your very own unique, hand-made piece for your own specific coffee rituals. Whatever gets you through your day is going to look amazing in a hand-made ceramic cup. These are decorated with a screen-printed underglaze which allows for precise and detailed decorations in fun, bright colors. This body of work is made from low-fire, white clay and covered in a clear glossy coat making it food safe. Each tier of work becomes more complicated in decoration, color, or set components but each is crafted out of love and passion. I hope you enjoy using your pieces as much as I have enjoyed making them.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">My at home studio is a small working space which doesn't allow for bulk work.
