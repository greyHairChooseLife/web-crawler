He did his first 'dry run' at the beginning of the week and then as soon as that ran smoothly, I loaded him up for his first bisque fire. He is now currently running bisque fire number two! He's adorable and small and I am so happy with him and super excited to be able to fire clay again. It was one thing being able to make work but now to actually be able to fire and complete it, I've just been overwhelmed with emotions the last couple of days. I don't think I realized exactly how small he would end up being though, the most important component was finding a kiln that would run out of a regular house outlet (still had to replace the wall outlet anyways though.) The kiln is only 9 inches deep and about 11 inches in diameter. To put that into some perspective I was able to put four cappuccino cups on one shelf, and I can fit maybe three shelves into a fire depending on the objects in the last two loads. Now because in glaze fires the objects can't actually touch each other or else they'll fuse (objects can touch each other in a bisque fire) I'm going to be able to load even less. So this really is small craft pottery. I appreciate the patience and the support while we were waiting for the kiln to arrive and now that he's here, there's more specific kinks to work out but at least the kiln is here. I'm going to order more kiln posts right now. I've got a lot on my plate so I really need to hustle this month but I'll update again when we start shipping and when the first pieces start to come out of the glaze fires.</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-id=\"34158797\">\n<figure class=\"page-anchor\" id=\"asset-34158797\">\n<div class=\"video-player\" data-video-url=\"https://v2.kickstarter.com/1667437225-O5nuUWST8zFPRJ7Xs9HOD0OcNoNnI9kgMSZRiYzx5es%3D/assets/034/158/797/19ff36be32905beb430fe826bdf15fcf_h264_high.mp4\" data-image=\"https://d15chbti7ht62o.cloudfront.net/assets/034/158/797/19ff36be32905beb430fe826bdf15fcf_h264_base.jpg?2021\" data-dimensions='{\"width\":640,\"height\":1152}' data-context=\"Update\">\n<video class=\"portrait\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"https://v2.kickstarter.com/1667437225-O5nuUWST8zFPRJ7Xs9HOD0OcNoNnI9kgMSZRiYzx5es%3D/assets/034/158/797/19ff36be32905beb430fe826bdf15fcf_h264_high.mp4\" type='video/mp4;
