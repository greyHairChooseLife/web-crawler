I have been selected to create this sculptural installation in NCECA's dynamic Project Space, adjacent to the vendors and gallery spaces. I will cover a 15'x15' area of the floor with unfired clay tile and then invite participants to interact with the space. The materials costs associated with pulling this off are approximately $1500 and time is running out!</p><p>An excerpt from the NCECA Journal:</p><p><i>Collective Confluence</i> is a space where our intersection during our three-day NCECA experience can be manifest physically and made plain to see. Part sociology, part archaeology, and part aesthetic experiment, this transitory installation depends upon viewer involvement to become a collaborative composition representative of this unique intersection. Participants in this project have the opportunity to impress their path on a 15’x15’ floor of wet clay tiles. Prior to walking on the tile floor, participants will have the option to create a small clay tribute to a personally relevant work of art. (Basic tools, a variety of clays, and a table space are at hand to facilitate this production.) Makers will then place their tribute in a location of their choosing upon the tiled area. Over the course of the installation, the cumulative effect of each person’s footprints, the on-site making, and collective curation of participant objects will yield an audience-specific composition. </p><p>This project ties together a number of the threads that have made up my studio practice over the past five years. I have an ongoing interest in how the collective unconscious comes to bear on pre-cognitive aesthetic preferences. I also continue to explore making time-based works. These have ranged from multiple-week outdoor installations to small scale functional objects designed so that their use enhance the surface for years to come (influenced by Mingei philosophy). With <i>Collective Confluence</i> I am more directly addressing the possibilities offered through participatory collaboration. Specifically, I am opening up the traditional maker:viewer relationship—the interplay between setup and audience response—with a more active requirement of my viewers. In this process I invite a lack of control over the final outcome. And, in so doing, have discovered that the unpredictable nature of the project and increased viewer engagement can be exhilarating. Past iterations of the project have yielded unexpected insights into human behavior. Each installation has been subject to the specific site and audience. As a result, the outcomes have varied dramatically. I look forward to what I can learn from my audience (you!) at the NCECA Conference. See you soon!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have created multiple versions of this project with varying scales, which makes me keenly aware of the potential stumbling blocks. Although this version will not physically be the largest I have attempted, it will have the largest audience and the shortest timeframe (set up, participation , and take down). The main challenge I foresee with this project is related to the timing. Specifically, I have 6 short hourshours to fully set up the 15'x25' space. It is for this reason than I am ordering a shipment of pre-made unfired clay tile. I have also assembled a team of assistants to help cut and place the tile.\r\n\r\nGiven that the conference will take place irrespective of my progress and that I see this as tremendous opportunity to present my work, I have carefully thought through the challenges inherent to the project and have multiple contingencies in place.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xODc2NjAxMDM4","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":4,"number_of_comments_depth_all":0,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nA 3-day participatory exhibition of unfired clay tile that records connections between makers at the annual ceramics conference.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/377/976/27ba9389bced34e05774ddc651fec209_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463757886&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=4af4987bf2712b6a024f990e480b3175","last_updated":"March 12, 2016","project_name":"ollective Confluence: A Project Space, NCECA 201","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"1,500","amount_of_pledged":"1,560","number_of_backers":"36","rate_of_funded":104,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Kansas City, MO","creator_name":"Brian Kluge","creator_location":"Madison, WI","creator_description":"Brian Kluge lives and works in Madison, Wisconsin.
