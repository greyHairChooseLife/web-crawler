I have been doing pottery for 4 years now and I absolutely love it! Pottery is my lifeline. Having suffered from mental health issues for many years I find that pottery helps me to feel centred (I do love a good pun!) and connected to nature in a way that I never knew I needed. I can get lost in pottery, it’s truly wonderful.</p>\n<p>During the day I work for a local branch of a national charity for elderly people, where I provide a free information and advice service for the residents of Medway. I love this job and find it very rewarding.</p>\n<p>For a while now I have wanted to be able to give the elderly residents of Medway the opportunity to practice the skill of pottery, as I feel that it would help reduce social isolation and would particularly benefit those elderly residents with Dementia. I have made some ‘Dementia Balls’ (please see the photo below) which have a small ball of clay inside them that you can feel and hear rolling around inside as you follow the continuous pattern on the outside. Pottery is a very tactile and soothing experience, exactly the kind of activity that is good for stimulating the mind. Renting a kiln is very expensive and would dramatically increase the costs involved in a project such as this. Having a kiln will enable me to run sessions at a much more affordable cost for those that have limited funds.</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"29259798\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/259/798/41e5c60d2a5d695ae11b66a5699f3c7b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1590691666&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=3463fc2ba1e24a1ae08b9c810c5fa0e8\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:course-details\" class=\"page-anchor\">Course Details&nbsp;</h1>\n<p>Working alongside local charities and community centres, I would like to run a low cost pottery course for the elderly residents of Medway.</p>\n<p>After isolation from COVID-19 ends there will be a lot of people who have lost loved ones, especially the elderly. Many of our elderly will have lost friends and partners and may have had their social circle severely reduced. I'd like to give them the opportunity to be able to express themselves through a soothing medium in a social environment where they feel safe. Given my experience within my day job, I will be in the perfect position to offer advice and signpost people to relevant organisations and make appointments for them to discuss any issues privately and confidentiality. I hold an up to date DBS certificate.</p>\n<p>My plan is to run courses in 6 week blocks, for 2 hours a week for 6-10 people at a time. I'd start off with one course as a pilot and gradually increase the number of courses depending on popularity and demand.</p>\n<p>If this course is successful, it is something that I would like to provide on an ongoing basis. I would like to take my equipment to local Care Homes, Day Centres, Residential Homes, Community Centres etc, and give them the opportunity to experience the same pleasure that I get from making things with clay.</p>\n<p>I would also like to offer future courses for vulnerable people, children with learning/behaviour difficulties and those who suffer from mental health and addiction issues.</p>\n<p>I have experience as a trainer and have delivered many courses on various subjects, and I believe that this experience, and my knowledge and familiarity of the clientele will enable me to make a success of this project. It is something that I am really passionate about.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h:breakdown-of-costs\" class=\"page-anchor\">Breakdown of Costs</h1>\n<p>Here is a breakdown of the costs of my project:</p>\n<p>Kiln - £650 - I will be getting either a top or front loading electric kiln that I can plug in with no hassle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clay and basic pottery tools for the pilot course - £72</p>\n<p>Kickstarter fees etc - £78</p>\n<p>By helping me to fund this project you will be helping me to breathe life into my dream, and enable me to pass on those benefits to the elderly population of Medway. These courses will be ran in my own time and I will not be making any profit. The purpose of this project is to provide a different activity for people to enjoy, after spending so much time in isolation, whilst doing what I love.</p>\n<p>I will provide updates to everyone who contributes to this project. If possible I'd like to be able to display the finished pieces in a local art gallery.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I have included some photos of my work, most are currently unfired due to a lack of a kiln, but it gives you an idea.</p>\n<p>Take care and stay safe.</p>\n<p>Karen</p>\n\n<div class=\"template
