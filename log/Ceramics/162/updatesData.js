Unfortunately this was significantly delayed due to lockdown, illness and injury! I not only had COVID, but I also injured my back and shoulder which required many visits to the osteopath and restricted my movement quite severely for around 4 months. I was also made redundant from my job, so I had to prioritise this in order to continue to provide for my children, which meant that saving up for the cost of the kiln installation was harder than I foresaw. But I got there!! I am now all better, employed again and working my way through your pieces that will be sent out as soon as possible.Â </p>\n<p>My new job still involves working with older people, but in Swale rather than Medway. However, now that things are starting to return to 'normal' with regards to COVID, and face-to-face sessions are now returning, I am looking to start the Medway based pottery sessions in the New Year! I have all risk assessments in place as well as public liability insurance, the sessions have been planned out and I have all of the equipment in place. I am good to go, as soon as I'm given the go ahead. It's all very exciting!!</p>\n<p>I'm also hoping to be running some pottery sessions in Swale via my current position, once the Medway sessions have been completed and evaluated.</p>\n<p>Apologies for the lack of communication, it's been a tough year! And I never want to experience home-schooling again! EVER! haha! I hope you are all well and haven't found the last year quite as difficult as I have.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions at all, please do contact me.</p>\n<p>Many thanks and kind regards,</p>\n<p>Karen</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1606939830,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMwMzkzOTg=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Almost ready!","publishedAt":1606939830,"pinnedAt":null,"number":5,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Karen Arnold","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/763/204/ead7d143020751dfd4a3b9b519436f2f_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1587141165&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=919d29718e9b2fce4fd8d85dc32cd290","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Hello everyone,Â </p>\n<p>I hope you are all well and looking forward to this crazy year being over?Â </p>\n<p>I bought my kiln a few months ago, a lovely Cromartie top loader.
