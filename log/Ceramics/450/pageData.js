I have been learning about and experimenting with ceramics at my local studio for about a year now and I've been making art my whole life! I have always been someone who loves put a lot of time and care into developing small and beautiful items. I found out that I am the same way in ceramics. I started making little tokens on a whim: they were easy to spend hours on at home and bring back to the studio for firing in the kiln. As I was looking at these tokens, a friend thought they were buttons because of the way I carved out the middle behind the stipe of the mushroom and I got to thinking... Well, for a button, this might be too delicate, but what about necklaces? I have been chewing on this thought for a while now and decided to take the plunge on Kickstarter for make 100! :) I am excited for you to join me on my journey as I post updates and progress. The two mushroom tokens pictured above are my prototypes and my inspirations. The ones I make for you all will be made from stoneware, porcelain, or mixtures of the two. This is a time for experimentation without sacrificing quality and I'm so excited to put myself out there and to share what I make with all of you. Thank you so much for reading. Please consider backing my Kickstarter, or even just sharing this link if you'd like to support me. :)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, I am open to messages, of course!</p>\n<br>\n<h1 id=\"h:designs\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">Designs:</span></h1>\n<p>Let's go into some detail! Since these designs will be made fresh for this project, I've got some sketches I'd like to share with you as well as general design plans and some prototypes of the designs that inspired this whole project!</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">In General:</span></p>\n<p>All of the tokens will be strung on a deep blue 100% silk ribbon. This is the color I am interested in.&nbsp;A major part of the limited edition aspect of these will be that I will be embroidering small symbols matching the necklace tokens on to this ribbon! I will not be doing this again as it will be a great undertaking of time and labor and if I do decide to try it again, it will not be the same symbols/token matching/ etc. (And probably at an increased cost!)</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"100% silk ribbon in &quot;marine&quot; blue\" data-id=\"27743869\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/743/869/21c65a02f974d69a0e53b5b5586b45f4_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1578983002&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=89344ff223db96e76439e1319f615916\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">100% silk ribbon in \"marine\" blue</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I think it will go well with the colors of both porcelain as well the brown stoneware. As for clasps and metal attachments, I am researching what would look the nicest but still be hypoallergenic. My first choice is something that is brass colored, but I will settle for something else to ensure safety for sensitive skin. Silver metals are also definitely on my mind! My plan is to seek out clasps that allow for an adjustable length, but this feature may end up being compromised. My concern is that the weight of the ceramic, while subtle to the wearer, will tug at any adjustable clasps, eventually pulling them to their maximum length, which is obviously undesirable! So I am eager to experiment with that and see if I can avoid or solve that problem. If not, they the necklaces will be at a fixed mid length but I could probable make them longer upon request if it's a big deal to the backer.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Bird Token:</span></p>\n<p>Here is a prototype, not yet fired, just carved to give you an idea of how the birds will appear somewhat!
