Our staff became complacent and our manager was not disciplined enough to follow through with daily duties.  As weeks passed we learned every employee was somehow related to our manager and her husband who mislead us on this matter during the interviewing process.</p>\n<p>At around the 12 week marker, we began to run out of materials and money.  This pulled Paul and I away from the facility frequently and due to the fact we did not have a vehicle in Belize, we relied on public transportation.  A three hour task or commute became an all day event in the high heat and humidity.  And the fact we have not been successful establishing a bank account at the 12 week marker made matters even more difficult.</p>\n<p>What appears to be a failed endeavor, takes a turn for the good in mid September.  Paul and I attended an expo in Belize City in the hopes of finding shipping material distributors. Instead, me meet Marie Sharps, <a href=\"https://www.mariesharps.bz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.mariesharps.bz/</a>.  We first learned of her while meeting with a prior US ambassador to Belize almost a year ago. This ambassador discussed with us who she was, her success, and gave us a sample of her pepper sauce.  At that time we reached out to Ms. Marie via email but had not heard back from her.  Upon us introducing ourselves and sharing a few of our frustrations, Ms. Marie introduces us to her general manager, Jody, and the desperately needed guidance begins.  Jody schedules a first meeting with us in his office for September 25th.  On September 27th, Ms Marie fully involves herself in getting our business on track.  She has resided in Dangria, Belize most of her life.  She has demonstrated her abilities and knowledge of manufacturing in Belize with her successful business of 38 years.  </p>\n<p>The past four months have been extreme to say the least, but we are now under Ms. Marie's advisement, guidance, and safety.  Paul and I know the holiday season is here and we are diligently working towards getting products shipped.  We have tied up some loose ends back in the states to obtain our bank account in Belize.  Our plan is to begin shipping Kickstarter Backers within the next three weeks.</p>\n<p>Here are some contact email addresses and telephone numbers.  Please reach out to us with questions.  Note: Communication can be difficult with all the tasks at hand and in a developing country. We are also go back and forth in time zones.  Central America does not recognize day light savings and currently we are two hours behind Eastern Standard Time.</p>\n<p><strong>Email</strong>: drollins@healingtouchpottery.com, pmowatt@healingtouchpottery.com, </p>\n<p><strong>Phone</strong>: US#603-933-2397,  Belize#011-501-614-8276</p>\n<p><strong>WhatsApp</strong> is a free app that is used internationally and allows communication through video, phone, and text messaging at no cost.   For Donna's <strong>WhatsApp</strong> 603-721-2894.  Paul's <strong>WhatsApp</strong> 603-767-0224</p>\n<br>\n<br>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1567092385,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI2MDgzMjI=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Progress update!

We have successfully transitioned over to Belize. This has been a very challenging experience with many unforeseen obstacles. Within our first six weeks we’ve had to relocate from one facility which had inadequate electricity for the kilns and insufficient space to another location that is more suitable for production. However, at our seventh week, our staff are fully trained and we are up and running. We have started shipping but products are going out the door a bit slower than we had hoped. Due to the set backs, our Kickstarter fulfillment will begin in 2 weeks. This is a temporary hump along our way as we figure out the flow of raw materials coming in and our gorgeous products going out to you. We appreciate your patience during this time.
