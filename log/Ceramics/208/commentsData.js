We relocated to the Stann Creek District in Belize under the advisement of Marie Sharp who is the owner of a very sucessful pepper sauce company.\n\nThank you so much for your patience and prayers. It was very depressing to have such a great vision and then learn we set up in the wrong village. Corruption is very prevalent here and our safety became an issue.\n\nWe have begun production to fulfill all the generous donations you all have given.  Although we are very late with ship dates, the product is just as beautiful as it was before with an even deeper meaning. The village we have relocated to are very grateful for our presence.  Our influence has inspired the surrounding neighbors to be more aware of their environmental foot print. \n\nAs mentioned in the past, Belize lacks opportunity. Through your donations, the people of this village have opportunities they did not have before such as jobs, educational workshops, and innovate recycling. Sometimes we cannot understand why we go through the experiences we do, but when the struggles pass, happiness returns. \n\nCurrently,  internet is spotty, but functional.  The two email addresses working are drollins@healingtouchpottery.com and pmowatt@healingtouchpottery.com.  The cell phone number is 0115016656255.
