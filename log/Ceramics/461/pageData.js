Didn't throw for a while... Mobile, AL, for 3 years working in wine retail, commercial equipment and banking. Then took a job in Honolulu, HI with an international shipping company based in Mobile, AL. Started home brewing in Honolulu after a family vacation to Denver, CO, and her surrounding breweries, then as a way of trying to find a way back to the Lowcountry transferred to Savannah with said shipping company and got the ball rolling with Wooden Skiff, to be Hilton Head Island's first distributed beer label. Began throwing again at Jacob Preston Studio with Brynne Bowler, culminating in 30 bowls  sold at the recent EMPTY BOWLS event at Preston Studio.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Tayloe Cook","creator_last_login":1516209893,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":2,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.woodenskiffbrewing.com","domain":"woodenskiffbrewing.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/082/304/f2b64f1edb50ba266efd1cbd58608165_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461501530&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=66cfea8f46207051c358e2ea5c3e73d7","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/753545469","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Starting a pottery is never a brilliant idea, especially in your parent's garage... Having just finished 7 months with Jacob Preston Studio off-island in Bluffton, and in a bid to positively influence the Hilton Head Art Scene, I am endeavoring to create a garage studio on Hilton Head. With a kiln committed, a 240v outlet in place, a potter's wheel and some clay - to start; I hope to grow production from oxidation to reduction firing- with a kiln made from an old electric body retrofitted with propane burners - and various slips and glazes for oxidation and reduction firing.&nbsp;</p><p>This whole process should take no more than two week of combined work, with oxidation pieces coming out around time for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kawanza. Initially tankards, bowls, plates, cups and mugs will be available through gallery locations and online store. With more exaggerated and contrived pieces following, maybe even a chandelier.&nbsp;</p><p>Having worked with, in showing and utilizing our pottery, Lucky Rooster Restaurant on Hilton Head, and contacted by Charleston and Savannah based chef's for local stoneware, our products have the ability to cater to both commercial and domestic use. From our Beer Tankards to Standard Dinner Plate, oxidation products are lead free and dishwasher safe, and can be enjoyed in multiple settings while not encumbering usual and time consuming hand-washing. Depending on glaze ingredients many reduction fired glazes are lead free dishwasher safe as well.</p><p>Build out includes little more than clean up, wheel and kiln installation and testing, of course, maneuvering old racks while reorganizing old equipment. An order for pickup at Highwater Clay in Asheville, NC, provides all needed accessories and accompaniments including tools, slips glazes etc. And we already have the website tayloepottery.com.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Risks include: kiln malfunctioning, ruining whole loads of work; glazes running and clay bodies melting; human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!\r\n\r\nChallenges include: testing new firing techniques and glazes; substantiating market share and evolving stylistically.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":4,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 35</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 35</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Hand thrown beer tankard. 1lb of clay</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-12-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Dec 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 35</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 35</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Hand thrown bowl. 1lb of clay</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-12-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Dec 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>FOUNDERS TANKARD -
