After much hard work, we are so so so excited to share with you the <b>Grand Opening of our new home </b>at 4 Westport Rd in KCMO.  Please join us on October 28th from 5-9pm for food, drinks and music while touring midtown Kansas City’s newest venue for fine studio pottery. All purchases will be discounted 10% during the Grand Opening celebration. <i>Halloween costumes are encouraged, but not required!  </i></p><p>Our new 1400 sq. ft. space is home to a 350 sq. ft. exhibition/shop space and a 1050 sq. ft. studio space. In addition to providing a storefront for locally made pottery, we will use the space to provide educational artist talks, workshops, communal food gatherings, and collaborations with area businesses and organizations.  Earlier in 2016 we were awarded a Rocket Grant to develop the cooperative space with the goal of sparking dialogue with the local community about the role of handmade pottery in daily life. </p><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.kcurbanpotters.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.kcurbanpotters.com</a> or contact kcurbanpotters@gmail.com</p><p>We hope to see you on the 28th and will post pictures on our instagram and facebook accounts for our friends who aren't local!</p><p>-Alex, Chandra, Erica, Meredith, Jana, Rain and Paul</p><a href=\"http://kcurbanpotters.com\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"KCUP members' cups\" data-caption=\"KCUP members' cups\" data-id=\"14054469\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"KCUP members' cups\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/054/469/15c3c1d8e61dfcd72ee31ecf3b587f5b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1476124246&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9d62654f19f303492c9f79990ef71107\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">KCUP members' cups</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> </p>\n</a><p> </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1418000414,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"6000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"11834.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":169,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1417463413,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEwNTA5ODY=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"6 Days Left - Please spread the word!","publishedAt":1417463413,"pinnedAt":null,"number":4,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"KC Urban Potters","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/322/135/0df00cecaaecc7720d29d07ad3750f48_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461579810&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=6afc00e955a8eaac43478692f92dce25","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"KCUP holiday sale\" data-caption=\"KCUP holiday sale\" data-id=\"2993753\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"KCUP holiday sale\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/993/753/0c0038bf5bdbe7b9e2d70beefa8fc731_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1417463218&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ce36b7d7d38e82f37bc595b1cf9212ee\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">KCUP holiday sale</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Thanks to all of our amazing supporters for helping us reach our initial fundraising goals.

Crowd funding is an effective platform for new organizations because each new backer strengthens the community of support. Every single dollar makes a difference. With the funds we have raised so far from our 152 awesome backers, we will be building display furniture for an annual invitational exhibition, a really great mobile pop-up display and we are sponsoring a class for youth at a local arts center. <b>We can honestly say that this could not be done without you.</b></p><p>If we meet our stretch goal of $11,400 we plan to apply to have an exhibitors booth for the <b>National Conference for Education in </b><b>the Ceramics Arts</b>.  This will be the 50th Anniversary of NCECA and it will take place here in Kansas City in the spring of 2016. A presence at this conference is a huge opportunity to connect Kansas City Urban Potters to the larger ceramic arts community. It will also allow us to be represented as makers in our home city for this landmark event. </p><p>We are still offering great rewards for your support of our next goal, helping KCUP build connections for our organization and for the community at the upcoming 2016 NCECA Conference in KC. <b>If you have already donated, THANK YOU!!</b> Please continue to help Kansas City Urban potters spread the word by sending an email to family and friends.  <b>Tweet about us, like us on Facebook or share the link on Facebook or Instagram</b>. \nAlthough we are sure that you can convey your own heartfelt message, we have written a sample email for you to send, if you prefer.</p><p>Dear Friends, </p><p>Kansas City Urban Potters is a new collective that I am supporting.

We are currently using a utility cart and string lights as a mobile pop-up display unit during events. Sounds less than ideal, right? Having a mobile display that reflects our aesthetic will help to convey a much more positive association for our pottery.  Simply stated:  if our mobile display looks better, we will look better and we’ll attract a bigger audience with our mission.  We have been researching mobile designs that are customizable to both workshop and/or display requirements.  We plan to set up this mobile display during First Friday art walks in the Crossroads District, and at the many cultural and educational events throughout Kansas City.  We've decided to set a stretch goal of $9000 to see if we can raise enough money to get a really great mobile pop-up display unit built.</p><p>As we were preparing this update, we just received a pledge from our 100th Backer.
