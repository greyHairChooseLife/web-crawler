We have two main goals: 1) host an annual spring invitational exhibition and 2) create personal connections through community engagement.  Our long-term vision includes integrating these two goals during a weekend full of workshops, community projects, and collaborative events with local chefs and organizations.  Our immediate plan is to start by establishing an annual spring invitational event, scheduled for May 8 – 10, 2015.</p><p>For our first event, we have invited six nationally recognized potters from around the country to exhibit alongside our core members. We are designing a display that feels like a well-designed home interior. We will construct flat-pack tables, risers and shelves: one for each core member and one for each invited artist. Providing well-designed furniture that is easy to assemble and transport will give the event a cohesive look. Quality wood is expensive, so the more money we can raise, the nicer we can make our display furniture.&nbsp;</p><div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>\n\n<h1 id=\"h:why-6000\" class=\"page-anchor\">Why $6000</h1>\n\n<p>In addition to\nbuilding displays and renting a venue, there are other upfront expenses\ninvolved in planning our yearly invitational, such as advertising, catering, lighting,\nand packaging. We want this to be an event people look forward to attending each year. We feel that even the small details are important\nto the success of our vision.</p>\n<p>Your Kickstarter pledges are an investment in KCUP’s future. Once we meet our Kickstarter goals, our yearly invitational will be a sustainable event.  We will use a percentage of each sale to pay for the following year’s sale expenses. \n\nGiving back to the community is important to us.  Although we are actively fundraising, we know that after our spring event, we will be donating a portion of the sale proceeds to fund a scholarship for a class at a local arts center.  These will be given to people in the Kansas City community who might not otherwise be able to attend.</p>\n<div>\n<h1 id=\"h:who-we-are\" class=\"page-anchor\">\nWho We Are</h1>\n<p>We are a recently formed\ncollective of potters in the Kansas City area started by Chandra DeBuse, Paul\nDonnelly, Jana Evans, Rain Harris, Meredith Host, Erica Iman, and Alex\nWatson. Find out more about each of our members through our website's <a href=\"http://www.kcurbanpotters.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">About</a> page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our members have a strong history of community involvement.&nbsp; In 2010, Jana Evans created her first event bringing community together through handmade pottery. &nbsp;This event raised over 440 pounds of food, which was donated to a local food pantry. Another KCUP core member, Paul Donnelly, is currently volunteering his time as the 2016 on-site liaison for the Kansas City NCECA (National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts) Conference. &nbsp;As a group, we will be organizing and participating in community-based events in order to help educate and increase awareness of our mission...and this gives us a chance to give back to Kansas City. We hope to get some clay in people's hands through pop-up workshops throughout town, to create personal connections with the community through farm-to-table, local, handmade pottery dinners, and to get a mug in everyone's hand so they can feel the difference something handmade can make in their morning coffee experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<div><br></div>\n<h1 id=\"h:rewards-for-your-sup\" class=\"page-anchor\">\nRewards for Your Support<br>\n</h1>\n<div>\n<p>As a Founding Supporter we hope to keep a relationship with you throughout our growth as an organization.
