I am super excited about taking on a commitment to my artwork this year. During the span of this residency I will be foucused on the landscape in the park and starting 6 to 8 new sculptures. However, money is tight and I need some help to fund my trip.</p><p> In exchange for your donation you will receive a hand made piece if pottery made by yours truly.See the video for the designs I have chosen. These designs will only be available through this fundraiser so get them now before they are retired for good.</p><p> In addition to this fundraiser, I have also applied for a grant from the Montana Arts Council in the amount of $1900.Funds will be used for travel expenses to and from Arizona, clay, firing and studio fees and living expenses while away for the month.</p><p> Follow my journey at Jesse Nevins Ceramic Art on Facebook to see where your donation goes!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show
