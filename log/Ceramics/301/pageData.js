Doodling in the margins became my signature. Modeling clay was my favorite toy. I told anyone that would listen that I was going to be an artist. When I got to high school I took ceramics, and somewhere during the creation of my first project and my amazing teacher's guidance, I knew that clay was my medium of choice.\r\n My teacher always said \"That shouldn't have survived! The clay gods love you.\" \r\nI went to college for art but then life happened.  I'm now a mom of four and I drive school buses for our local school district. It's a great life but I've never forgotten my dream of being a ceramicist.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Angela Yelton ","creator_last_login":1482638587,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":3,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/falconfirestudio/","domain":"facebook.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/707/911/eecc38b9c261e055bfcd2a3f0a8a5f65_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1480731892&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=6bc856bac1eed77f48a2e6a66bbf887f","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1772555916","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>All I want is to bring the love of clay and ceramic to my small town.

I just need the space! I also already have a whole bunch of people wanting to participate.</p><p>I have two galleries in the neighboring towns wanting to show for me and my students. The middle school offers a session in ceramics but that's all. I want to eventually use my sales of school-related mascot imagery to donate money to my school system's art department as well.</p><p>I'm a mom of four, a school bus driver, and an artist.
