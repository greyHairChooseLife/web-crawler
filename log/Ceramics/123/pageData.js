College, I am working on developing my senior art thesis exhibit. My exhibit will be displayed on campus from May 4th to May 16th of 2015. For my senior thesis, I am focusing on creating ceramic forms that are mainly bowls and plates. I have been using Batik as a model for decorating pottery. I am working on combining the concept of Batik, a process of dying fabrics with wax designs on them, with pottery. The process of Batik is structured and organic. I am fascinated with how the patterns are created and how the dye runs and blends the colors while the wax controls to what extent the colors are blended.&nbsp;In order to produce the effect of Batik, I must fire the pieces multiple times. I am making works of pottery that are beautiful and functional.</p><p>The way I begin this process is by taking a hard piece of paper and cutting out a pattern. Then, I trace the pattern onto the already fired clay. In these shapes and forms, I will be referencing different parts of nature within my design. The piece is then high fired, and afterwards, I use a water-based wax along with glaze to create a second coat of design and fire it again. I continue the re-firing process until I arrive at a point in which I am satisfied with the piece.&nbsp;</p><p><i>The process is very redundant, and as I explore it, I am intrigued by the new piece that is produced after multiple firing. I want people to be able to look at my piece and see the process of how it was made.</i></p><p><span class=\"bold\">The funding for this project will be used for&nbsp;</span><span class=\"bold\">High Fire Glazes, paint brushes, and pottery tools</span><span class=\"bold\">.&nbsp;</span>Every donation is appreciated! Please help me reach my goal! Thanks!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The show and graduation are in May so it will also be graduating.
