She taught herself how to create ocarinas, whistles made of clay, and her ocarinas have been featured in magazines and books. This year she was finally accepted into the Pittsburgh Society of Artists, a society that has already gotten her pieces placed in several local shows giving her a real opportunity to make back some of the money she has spent honing this skill.&nbsp;</p><p>Bryna gives back to the local art community - having previously donated her time to assist in the ceramic department of both the PCA and local public schools. She has gone into urban schools and taught children the basics of making simple ceramic shapes called \"pinch pots\" and used her low-fire kiln &nbsp;to fire the pieces for local children's camps. Most of my friends and all of my family have pieces of her work that she has generously given away. One of her special favorite things to do is make a hand made piggy bank with a child's name on it and give it as a gift to new parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Each year Bryna purchases an annual membership to the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts where she utilizes their facilities and kilns to finish her creations. Without access to these facilities she has no ability to produce completed work. This year she was hit with unexpected expenses caring for her sister through the process of beating cancer (Aunt Cheryl is cancer free now!!!) as well as unexpected home repairs when her roof decided it should rain in the living room. She asked me what she should do and since I do not have the money to buy her membership outright this was the best solution I could come up with.&nbsp;</p><p>Please help me help my mom get the access to art facilities she needs to continue to build and grow her artist reputation by having new completed pieces through 2016 to show through her membership to the Pittsburgh Society of Artists.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Since our goal is the process itself all that is needed is the funding.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":4,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A personalized hand written thank you card featuring a full color photo of Bryna's most recent show-piece Porcelain Vase</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-11-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Nov 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A pocket sized one or two note ocarina (ceramic whistle)</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-10-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Oct 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (6 left of 6)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A hand made ceramic mug - some of these may also whistle (chosen at the artists discretion.)
