My name is Cassia and I am the artist who make the ceramics which has my own name: <a href=\"https://www.cassiamayos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassia Mayos Ceramic Studio&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>I started out in ceramics about two years ago. I had a fitness competition costume making studio from my own conservatory in my home until I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. And because of my illness my husband looking for alternatives to help me cope with it found a pottery classes and It was when I started. In the beginning it was just a therapy to help with my illness but after a while I created a strong bond with the clay experimenting different figurative art work then I bought my kiln, an very old giant that has been an fire angel. I have made my home conservatory my small and cozy studio and I cherish it so much.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Functional work was not my favorite thing to make until the day my husband requested me to make for himself a set of bowls. It seems that I could really enjoy more my soup in that bowls. The sound of the metal spoons pinging in the ceramic surface, the heavy weight and the smoothness of the ceramic holding it while enjoy my food sounded quite magical, different. Then I've made mostly all of our kitchen ware and home decor, discarding mostly Ikea and Tescos' ware we had for so many years. It is just so magical and nice to enjoy your food in a handmade ceramic bowl, believe me! My desire for creating functional ceramic was great and I began experimenting with glazes and their combinations but as an illustrator (self-tough) I could not see my own ceramic pots in a plain glazes and there are many amazing, beautiful choices of glazes in the market plus I could make my own glazes too. I love to an illustrated pot, with a story or something to make me think about good things so every single pot I've made has an illustration. I think this year I've started find my own voice, shapes and what exactly I am with the ceramics and express what words cannot describe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Where I get my inspirations from you may ask, from everywhere, from a morning walk with my dogs into the woods, from magical stories and mystical tales, books. And because I've watched so much cartoons on tv in my childhood I think it influenced every art work I've done in ceramics or other medium, you can notice it by my characters and vibrante contrasting colours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I started showing my ceramics on Facebook (you can find me at Cassia Mayos Ceramic Studio) and Instagram(@cassiamayos) since I started with my pottery classes and things started to move forward, people are really so nice and supportive. I started making local markets this year too and it has been so pleasant, overwhelming to see in person whose is adopting my pots and their words are so motivacional.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With just a little push through Kickstarter I could continue to build my brand and grow my small business. This is my full-time job and I am very serious about developing product lines and evolving my artistic expression.</p>\n<br>\n<p>The Kiln</p>\n<p>My current kiln is old, manufactured by KL Furnaces which it has stop producing kilns and potteries equipments after been one of the most important manufactures in the UK for years since Victorian Era. I've bought it used but in good conditions and served well for more than a year but it began having trouble months ago and it is gotten worse and to make it function well I'll need spend couple of pounds that I don't have, also it's not worth to get it fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I am to continue my ceramic line production and to expand it, I would need a new kiln. This is my dream and my dream job - be able to develop as an artist and make it as a living, supporting myself and my family. I hope you will help me achieve my goal in raising the necessary funds. When supporting this campaign you will support my art and you will receive something very unique for yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I am asking your help. Being a self-employed of a small business and starting as I did means I do not have money laying around. If I don't reach my goal in 38 days it means that no one will get charged (and I don't get anything either) so it's all or nothing. Please help by sharing this project through social media or to your friends and family.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and thank you in advance for your pledge and good karma!</p>\n<br>\n<p>Cassia</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The biggest risk in completing my project is that I die or having my hand gutted off.
