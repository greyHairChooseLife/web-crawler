WE'RE TAOS CLAY STUDIO AND ACCELERATED KINETIC ARTS!</span></h1><p>Taos Clay Studio is a ceramic art center dedicated to the spread of contemporary clay culture within Taos County, and across the country. We are a community-based organization hosting lectures, workshops, and events to promote art education and hands on learning. We foster an environment of creativity catering to all ages and skill levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Founded twelve years ago by Page Patterson Taos Clay has been making an impact on the local art scene since its doors opened. In April of last year the studio underwent a major change when Brandi Jessup our current owner and director purchased the studio from local artist and entrepreneur Logan Wannamaker. Building on twelve years of history and awesome, we are growing at a rate we never could have anticipated!</p><p>We firmly believe in the power and importance of arts education and its ability to impact lives. Through memberships and classes, internships and residencies, we build opportunities for lifelong learning and experimentation in the visual arts.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">In January of this year we partnered with Travis Webb of Accelerated Kinetic Arts to open a second space dedicated to bringing artists of all media together.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>The AKA Studio is a think tank for artists, business people, martial artists, actors, dancers, and creative people of all backgrounds and skills to come together. We create conversation and connect the dots between media to generate both artistic and economic impact!&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:what-if-im-not-from\" class=\"page-anchor\">WHAT IF I'M NOT FROM TAOS?</h1><p>We want to make an impact, not only in our local community, but around the country.&nbsp;</p><p>We host studio programs for people from all over the world. We are home to a residency program which brings in two emerging artists for a one year work exchange. Our residents keep the studio running! They teach, organize gallery shows, fire kilns, formulate glazes, run marketing campaigns, plan events, help with our outreach programs, and make sure Taos Clay is the most amazing place around!</p><p>Check out our current residents Rickie Barnett and Ian Connors!</p><a href=\"https://rickiebarnett45.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Rickie Barnett looking like a badass!\" data-caption=\"Rickie Barnett looking like a badass!\" data-id=\"3458319\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Rickie Barnett looking like a badass!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/458/319/cc5d5b0314e0c9547a2c23e404a3a661_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1426637850&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b5ccefe8fa4b213be650a11544c8d371\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Rickie Barnett looking like a badass!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Ian Connors rocking the pots!\" data-caption=\"Ian Connors rocking the pots!\" data-id=\"3458329\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Ian Connors rocking the pots!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/458/329/f539d96f40dba8dc9517e274c847c0c6_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1426638010&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=55957c441a6c83602bbeb6ca48a2005c\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Ian Connors rocking the pots!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;We have some rocking interns as well!

The business was purchased on a shoestring budget and the overhead is high. We have faced our share of risks and challenges pretty much since the day the studio changed hands one year ago. We have more than 30 amazing, crazy, talented artists working together in a small space collaborating an all manner of projects. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenges we have faced so far are financial. Taos is a seasonal economy and our first winter was scary. On top of the already sketchy economy we are expanding A LOT, and that takes money and lots of it. Additionally like most Taos structures our building is old. It has quirks and oddities and lots of old bits that need updated. \r\n\r\nWe are at a critical point right now. We are right on the verge of making real leaps in our offerings and real impact, but we need the infrastructure and the man hours to accomplish it. We are working right now on the love, support and volunteer hours and expertise of a LOT of lovely people. But without the staff and the equipment to maintain ourselves we won't be able to move forward.\r\n\r\nWe need to show our local supporters that we have the money behind us to sustain the growth.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":20,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Official Taos Clay and AKA Postcard!</p>\n\n<p>Let everyone know how awesome you are with an official Taos Clay and AKA postcard.
