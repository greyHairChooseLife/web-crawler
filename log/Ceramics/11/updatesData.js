While the original combustible-mould Lost Cardboard Process is very satisfying and poetic, unfortunately it is also very laborious, expensive and prone to failure. I wondered if I could translate the beloved crumpled texture into a mass-produceable format, which could be more reliably and economically produced by a factory. I eventually got chatting to Royal Stafford - one of the oldest potteries in Staffordshire (a historic ceramics producing region of the UK), and they were open minded enough to take on this unusual job. I gave them a plaster cast of one of the cardboard mug moulds, and they used it to create production ready slip moulds. I still find it hard to fully comprehend how they managed to capture all the complex texture in a plaster mould which can be taken apart and re-assembled (I only know about single-use ones which burn away into nothing), but they clearly knew what they were doing and did an amazing job!  </p>\n<a href=\"http://www.raygbrown.com/shop/origami-mug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"25073988\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/073/988/1ab569cc1d4fee0c304641b7a764753e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1557383877&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6ccead676f200b366626cb2b0f33935e\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</a>\n<p>I'm sure many of you are very eager to compare and contrast this new manufactured version against the original oldschool experimental one you have owned and cherished since the Kickstarter campaign.

I couldn't have done it without you! I will leave you with a piece of official description which further explains why the <em>Origami Mug </em>is totally fantastic for not only me and you, but the ceramics industry and humanity and the entire world at large:</p>\n<p><em>Origami Mug demonstrates how an experimental making process can be translated into a mass-manufactured product, while still retaining the intriguing character of the original. The intricate texture and asymmetry of the design means that it can’t be effectively produced by an automated process. It is therefore created through slip casting - an extremely craft-centric method, which requires dedicated, knowledgeable potters to cast and finish each mug by hand.</em></p>\n<p><em>This collaboration is a satisfying compromise between the attractive idiosyncrasy of experimental craft (which is laborious and expensive to produce), and the efficiency of factory production (which is often impersonal and aesthetically unexciting). Origami Mug is the best of both worlds: beautiful to behold, created at an affordable price point, and supportive of the impressive human skill which still proudly prevails in the British ceramics industry.</em></p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1529343289,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIyMTQxMTk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"LAVA CANDELABRA - the new hot thing on the scene..","publishedAt":1529343289,"pinnedAt":null,"number":22,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Ray Gonzalez Brown","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/246/456/b0d2a89435c0491bc771349fc8c91dec_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1477349337&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=4312be918ba2f8ca7067e652d7ee5dde","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Dearest Backers,</p><p>I have just launched another Kickstarter campaign...entitled <i>Lava Candelabra!</i></p><p>Two years on from Cardboard Ceramics, I have taken everything I have learned, and used it to create these magnificent molten mountains<i>:</i></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"21585061\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/585/061/12921e63c6e47c6e377cedd10b1a1ecd_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1529010295&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b8db1df6f51b0d0cde2e5838cbf47edd\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> Probably the most exciting volcano-themed product to erupt onto the scene this year :-)</p><p>I thought that you highly refined and very-good-taste-having backers might be extremely interested in checking it out <b><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2141199654/77031400?ref=536uxb&amp;token=c5af6c76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</b> The video is pretty amusing, and remarkably short, so there is very little for you to lose..</p><p>Thanks v much for your attention and support - greatly appreciated, as always :-)</p><p>Very best,</p><p>Ray</p><p>PS by all means spread the word to all other lava lovers out there!</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1520428048,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIxMzA5Mzk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Cardboard Ceramics (& Crisp Bowls) at Aram Gallery","publishedAt":1520428048,"pinnedAt":null,"number":21,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Ray Gonzalez Brown","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/246/456/b0d2a89435c0491bc771349fc8c91dec_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1477349337&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=4312be918ba2f8ca7067e652d7ee5dde","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Dear Everyone,</p><p>Hope you are well!

Many other designers and journalists got a chance to see what we are all about, and this will all have a subtle cumulative effect. It was also great to demonstrate our enthusiasm and capabilities to Kickstarter - who came to see the show and thought it was way cool, and liked how we have used their platform to achieve an original kind of project. We certainly hope to work with them again in the future!</p><p>2) We all managed to sell some of our products over the 2 week exhibition - therefore proving their commercial viability beyond their inital Kickstarter stage. We sold enough to assure SCP that we are worth their shelf space, and so they agreed to buy more of our stock to sell in their shop, post LDF! So we can all now proudly say that they are our stockist. This is a very cool and significant milestone to us - it feels really great to have made the most of our blessed foot in the door. These opportunities are so very hard to come by, and its so interesting to think that it all came from the initial credibility we achieved from our Kickstarter campaigns. This really is the game-changing way of the future for young designers, and we hope to spread the word to more young designers in the future. </p><p>So before too long, the Cardboard Ceramics will feature on the SCP online shop, alongside the ceramic works of other such esteemed designers such as Max Lamb, Anouk Jansen, Reiko Kaneko etc. Pretty cool -rest assured I will show you a screenshot when this happens..</p><p>3) One little instance of personal excitement for me. SCP informed me that two of my coffee mugs were bought by none other than Rachel Whiteread - legendary artist and expert caster of mundane things! This is real celebrity moment for me as I have always loved her work, and upon seeing her retrospective at the Tate recently, I realised that she is actually an inspiration for the little crumpled casts I make now. So very validating to hear this news!

The righteous folks at Kickstarter were similarly stoked with our innovative means of using their platform, and so they kindly sponsored the design and production of a very profesh and handsome exhibition booklet, which also folds out into a totally timeless poster:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"18285813\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/018/285/813/6d0c657258b39a5233ddfc30feb9643d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1505166094&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6e753e70fe1e991f32045ca73ab2d306\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> A true commemorative collectors item, to be sure. Big thanks to Kickstarter for this - it was definitely the right choice for everyone involved! Head to the exhibition to pick up one for your very own...</p><p>BUT wait - that's not <b>actually</b> all! The Cass (London Metropolitan University) also - understandably - really appreciate the value of this project by us graduates, of whom they are most proud. And so they too were also really cool, and generously helped fund our making of a very slick and beautiful exhibition stand. It will be made of the finest Valchromat (a fancy alluring coloured version of MDF) and other things also, and will look really fresh - as soon as I build it tonight with fellow <i>Cass Starter </i> <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1750177337/wobbly-peyote-a-cactus-themed-desktop-toy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tim Summers</a>.

It has been such a regrettably long time since my last update, and for this I apologise..there has been a lot going on over here, you see. First of all, I have been back at my day job for a long stint of gruelling carpentry, doing lots of this:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16595894\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/595/894/de8af6be66aa32bd70fb1e002e6c4846_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494338817&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b859c571a8956e3f36fd5f4200228950\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> Which was horrible, but also some of this:\n</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16595896\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/595/896/9fb4ec2d517895f15ed36c23168f32f7_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494338833&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c9bc209b4cb7114738313c1d3995878c\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> Which is always kind of fun tbh. And also very good for £ which is always important! But enough about all that - I am now happily back in the studio for a fair few days. Which brings me to the other thing I have been busy with: Moving Studio!</p><p>Yes, my previous place was nice, but unfortunately also such a debilitating and unsustainable assault on my money after a while. London workshop rent is very depressingly expensive, and hard to maintain if you don't yet have a proper cash flow from your business. But thankfully, I have found an old garage that I have kindly been allowed to churn out ceramics in until at least the end of the year. I am very lucky and thankful, not least because this new place is actually better than the old one in every way! Let me give you a virtual tour, in a manner most estate agent-ish...\n</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16595921\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/595/921/f4dce1732ee53883c9a54e928368046b_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494338907&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ade4d95ceabb5d4a64f11d1508804e51\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> So first of all you can see the totally authentic and characterful victorian brickwork (I think it was actually once a stable?) and also the 100% rustic and charming wooden doors which fold up all concertina-like to give access straight onto the street - extremely helpful for dragging in heavy kilns and bags of clay and what have you..</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16595925\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/595/925/2180f1c6e94b0bd22ad436423158acac_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494338919&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4f027b83d3e02bfba8765678335d90a5\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>And of course the interior is luxuriously furnished with a smart suite of green-MDF-and-pine furniture, and old-splintery-floorboard shelves: the winning interior design combination that has now become a distinctive trademark of the Ray G Brown studio aesthetic. And look at the extra amount of space I now have! The floor plan is a fair few square feet larger than before, which affords me plenty of room for rushing from one workbench to the next without knocking too much stuff over while I do it. Also extra handy space for Piles of Cardboard (aka valuable making materials) and Dirty Buckets, placed conveniently at feet level. See the sweet little bisqued cups patiently awaiting glazing on the right, and a few new Intriguing Experiments taking place on the left. But more on that later..\n </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16595934\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/595/934/1b5d5923e61e4ed15f774e1e79afcd17_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494338950&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d68da92045656ab5c675f8a7123a3c5a\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>  And then the stunning deal-breaker feature is the soothing and peaceful view of the bucolic street outside - instantly accessible with one deft scraping heave of the aformentioned 100% charming and rustic doors. On a nice sunny day, its a real pleasure to see the gusts of cardboard smoke gently waft their way down the street from the extraction wall on the right, and also vaguely wonder what the neighbours must think of all this :-)</p><p>Another great new feature is this:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16595942\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/595/942/c6131793705af8cad4f0f35829e45ffd_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494338969&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2b39f69316767b8f67ad0b649f618b84\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>  The Shelving Unit Full of Exciting New Products In Development, and also Screws and Toothbrushes. But more on this later...\nSo great stuff all around. I would like to thank you all again for helping me get to this point - when I graduated almost a year ago, I really didn't think that I would so soon have an engaging project on the go, with a cool place to make it in and a business gradually being built around it. The whole Cardboard Ceramics Kickstarter experience was a hugely valuable learning curve. And since I have finished with my last remaining orders, I have been constantly working to get my head around all the challenging and stressful and often ambiguous and confusing aspects of forming a business and a brand for myself. But however much of a struggle it often feels like, I am always reassured in the back of my mind by how all of you righteous backers had faith in my ideas, and saw some value in my work, and believed that it was worth encouraging. And the fact that I can share this journey with you through these updates can make it feel a bit less lonely. i feel very lucky that my first set of customers are not just clients, but are more like involved patrons who are more engaged with my practice on a more intimate level. I think that's quite a rare thing, and that there is a real value to it! </p><p>Also thank you for being patient with all the problems and idiosyncrasies that I have encountered along the way. There was quite a big learning curve I faced in figuring out how to produce 200+ cups to a consistent standard...plenty of confounding little things going mysteriously wrong all the time, forcing me to constantly adjust my making methods. And unfortunately, part of being a patron of an artist in his early years is how you have to experience these teething problems! But your feedback (both good and bad) and tolerant understanding was invaluable in my solving these problems, and most of them seem to be under control. For example, I had this relentless issue of too much slip pooling on the bottom of the cups, sometimes causing less-than-ideal cracks. I tried many things: changing the consistency of the slip, changing the temperature they were drying at etc, until I came up with this:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16691377\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/691/377/c260dea0f4c67f291fdc864f51a42b4d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494929213&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=54a691e81588b4a6a92cddcd45f1dc5a\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> Turning Them Upside Down! So the slip drains out instead of pooling at the bottom. Imagine that! Quite glaringly obvious when I think about it now, but sometimes the right solution is the most simple one. But unfortunately there was no existing textbook on Cardboard Ceramics to tell me this ahead of time, so I'm glad I had all of you to help me figure it out.</p><p>So anyway: the future is looking bright and exciting for Cardboard Ceramics. I have new orders coming in here and there - including this one sort of fun specific commission for the Sustainability Department of my old university London Metropolitan:\n</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16691383\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/691/383/f6f79bcc9cf7507c40d0fa3089c796c6_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494929238&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=731a3e3cd183ca3c803b3bcc1ab396fe\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>(Doesn't really look like anything now, but photos of finished objects to follow soon).</p><p>And my fellow Cass Starters and I are also brewing up a cool little exhibition / retail opportunity thing, at a very legit furniture shop in London who wants to showcase our student crowdfunding adventure to the world. Still early days of planning - so more on this later... </p><p>And I have also been putting my fabulous personal kiln to incessant good use, covertly developing several new products, which I am excited to show you soon. This Friday I have a photoshoot scheduled, so that I may have a fresh and totally profesh new batch of images to represent the Cardboard Ceramics experience. Hold on until after then, and I will proudly update you on these NEW ITEMS.

Of course, there has been one last thing delaying the final send-out. I have been awaiting an important shipment which I need for branding the delivery boxes (you'll see)...and its been delayed, and delayed, to the point where all the postage I have bought from Royal Mail has expired :-) so I can't send anything, and I have to book the postage again, and hassle these Royals for a (sizeable) refund, and maybe never use them again if I can help it because this is most idiosyncritic and inconvenient and etc etc etc...<br><br>But in more positive news, I have figured out a great way of packaging the blessed cups! As you know, expanded polystyrene is all hydrocarbon intensive, and non-biodegradable, and total pacific-ocean-floating-rubbish-island vibes, and therefore a most unsuitable and unconscientious choice for packaging anything really, but especially not for packaging these most eco-friendly Cardboard Ceramics cups. (For as you all well know, these cups are inspirational emblems for sustainable lifestyle practices, in how they make innovative and transformative use of a disposable and wasteful material :-) and this is the good word that you must spread to all of your friends who care about our planet!</p><p>So I've found this cool company called Eco Void Fill, who make packaging materials which are entirely made of paper. Check out the dimpled protective wrapping paper, and scrunched up \"paper nut\" things, which pack out the inside of the box alongside the cup: </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15895724\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/895/724/2ec378924caece7f5405cdde086a77e9_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1489706819&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=109e8cf63735b0a4d94ac6b86e4ac825\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>So everything is paper and recyclable, except for the ceramic cup itself. it also makes for a great visual experience - the beige cup amidst all the beige paper, being born out of it like a cardboard phoenix out of a cardboard fire, or something.</p><p>The packaging also works btw - i tested one by kicking it around the studio for quite a while and it was absolutely fine. The paper nuts sort of expand inside as they are moved around, so end up packing in the cup even more tightly. </p><p>I have purposely not shown you any images of the final glazed cups (except for that sneaky preview above), because I think it will be much more cool for you to unleash them from their three layers of camouflaging paper and behold them for yourselves like archeological treasures. I should have this first batch posted out early next week, once all this postage mess has been sorted out a bit more. I shall let you know. In the meantime, many more cups are queued up to be similarly packaged, and a constant procession of even more cups are steadily trudging in and out of the constantly-running kiln...</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15895732\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/895/732/38952f6fee9f6819e5a287ec67f361a3_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1489706846&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=54a8b3e644d62b755b05c29e7215b8aa\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> Thank you as always for being such patient and loyal backers!

After much palaver I switched it around with the old one and connected up the electricity and extraction etc. One positive aspect of this experience is that I got to have a look inside the extraction box - look how burnt and crusty it is after so many sessions of intense cardboard roasting:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15764438\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/764/438/2b0fc620ade4432cea5a7f39ca73cb1e_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1488837670&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c7b807b8195fa1d90b119b7c90549154\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> After seeing this I decided to put an extra hole in the bottom of the new kiln, so more cardboard ash can be sucked out of it into the system.<br><br>So now I could do some glaze tests, to figure out how to get the exact desired effect. This is where all those defective espresso cups (which couldn't stand up) become very useful: as test cups for the glaze:</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15764878\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/764/878/4624470aa907e2276aef07950fe1956a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1488839210&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9f436697840aea0f7ba1fc62bb11f348\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> The glaze fires between 1250 - 1280 degrees C. The different temperatures between these two extremes give different effects. The lower the temperature, the more matt of a finish the glaze will have (which is what I want, in order for the cups to look just like cardboard). However, if the temperature is too low, then the glaze doesn't melt properly at all, and it goes all weird and streaky (the one on the left):</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15764913\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/764/913/5ab7e5e3ea811d5a4b857f08a96af94f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1488839375&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d8b0718f895d3df24727490352384d35\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>But if the temperature is too high, then the glaze goes all glossy, which doesn't look good either. Tricky! After several tests (each taking 12 hours to fire and then another 5 hours to cool down), I figured out the optimum temperature to be 1265 degrees.

And I have only just realised this, now I have come to do the glaze firings. The glazes I am using fire between 1250 - 1280 degrees C (as do most stoneware glazes). However, when I tried to program the kiln to fire at this temperature, it wouldn’t let me...because the model they sent me only fires up to 1200!

In the meantime, I am unable to glaze fire any of the cups...which means they will not be ready to send to you loyal backers for a little while! :-(</p><p>I am most apologetic and regretful about this myself.

(And of course, please show any your friends who may have missed out on the campaign, but nonetheless have a deep need for some corrugated ceramics in their lives :-) :</p><p><a href=\"http://www.raygbrown.com/shop/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.raygbrown.com/shop/</a></p><p>Cheers guys!</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1479715731,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE3NDMwMzg=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Final 8 days","publishedAt":1479715731,"pinnedAt":null,"number":5,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Ray Gonzalez Brown","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/246/456/b0d2a89435c0491bc771349fc8c91dec_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1477349337&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=4312be918ba2f8ca7067e652d7ee5dde","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>And now we approach our final week of Cardboard Ceramics being live on the Kickstarter airwaves.

This is an event which discusses and explores the range of ways one can achieve funding for a project in this day and age. We will be presenting and speaking about the Cass Starters project, and explaining how us four recent design graduates worked together to harness the benefits of crowdfunding, with such fantastic results. </p><p>Also, I have expanded my range of shipping options to include several more European countries. I initially limited my shipping because I wanted to keep things simple for my first attempt at Kickstarter...but now I understand it a bit more, I realise it is better to include more places. Only a week to go, I know...but better late than never!
