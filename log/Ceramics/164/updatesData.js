Written by Stuart Low and published in the Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle last October. Photos below by Jamie Germano.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Art of Hope</b></p><p>            For some\r\nbreast cancer patients, the most healing touch is the one they use to make art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            On a recent\r\nnight, four Monroe County women create decorate tiles at a Rochester pottery\r\nstudio. One of them stamps delicate floral patterns on a clay slab. It feels\r\nlike moist cookie dough—and she uses a cookie cutter to slice off the imprinted\r\ndesign. Then she fastens it to a ceramic tile for slow firing in a kiln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            Across the\r\nwork table, another woman coats a silk screen with purple glaze. It seeps onto\r\na tile below, creating a textured fan shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            “You can\r\nwipe it off with a sponge if you don’t like it!” says instructor Marsha King,\r\n60, a Brighton potter. “Make sure it’s what you want. When you’ve finished,\r\nit’ll take the clay several weeks to dry.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            But\r\nartistic perfection isn’t what lures these four students to Genesee Pottery at\r\n713 Monroe Ave. All of them have survived breast cancer—from near-fatal ordeals\r\nto successful lumpectomies. They gather here to share stories and encouragement\r\nwhile making ceramic gifts for their families and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            The\r\nRochester area offers an exceptional variety of activities for breast cancer\r\nsurvivors. The Breast Cancer Coalition of Rochester alone serves about 2,500\r\npeople a year in classes ranging from t’ai chi to drawing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            Often run\r\nby volunteers, such local programs offer emotional support and group activities\r\nthat help jump-start patients sapped by chemotherapy and radiation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            Genesee\r\nPottery’s classes are believed to be among the few anywhere that use ceramics.\r\nThey have been administered since 2008 by the Genesee Center for the Arts &amp;\r\nEducation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            “Everybody\r\nhere has gown down the same road,” says participant Kate Chace, 50, of\r\nFairport, who had advanced metastic cancer. “This is a sisterhood, if you will,\r\nwhere we laugh a lot. The biggest thing it represents for me is hope.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            She has\r\nundergone weekly chemo sessions since 2008 and was declared stable just three\r\nweeks ago, after trying new drugs She celebrated by making a mug for her\r\ndaughter, Courtney, to put on her desk at the Pentagon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            Ama Merla\r\njoined the pottery class after having a bilateral mastectomy and plastic\r\nsurgery. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>            “I was\r\ndiagnosed last year on 9/11.” Says the Henrietta resident. “After that, my twin\r\ntowers came down. The recovery took a lot longer than I expected, and I just\r\nwanted to withdraw and heal. But now, thanks to my lovely husband Bruce, I have\r\nthe feeling ‘Let’s get on with it.’ ”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            As a\r\nmassage therapist, she’s aware of the healing that can take place through\r\ntouch. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>            “I really\r\nenjoy the tactile part of clay,” she says. “I had a zest for pottery in my\r\nyouth, and my hands were yearning to touch it again. For me, it connects back\r\nto the creative spirit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>            She\r\nrecently made a ceramic “wish fish” with bulbous eyes and a picture of the sun\r\non its belly. Whisper a wish to this strange creature and it’ll give you a new\r\nbeginning—guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            King\r\nherself is a breast cancer survivor and started the class as a part of her\r\nhealing process. A retired nurse, she has seen the benefits of hands-on art\r\nactivities for a wide variety of patients. She teaches four pottery classes a\r\nquarter. Each session begins with women talking about their personal lives and\r\nbuilding a sense of camaraderie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            “Some of\r\nthe women are doing well,” she says. “But we had one person pass away and it\r\nprofoundly affected the entire group. We made a collective pot and gave it to\r\nher family.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            King had a\r\nlumpectomy in 2007 and underwent radiation treatments. She wears a compression\r\nsleeve to control swelling in her left arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            “I’ve never\r\nhad any additional evidence of cancer,” she says. “But you can never say that\r\nyou’re cured.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>            Among local\r\nbreast cancer programs, the Genesee Pottery class might be unique. It welcomes\r\nback “alumnae” if they have a relapse or just want to make a few more pots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            Class\r\nmember Mary Pat Magde has found the studio a good place to make friends. Old\r\nand new participants can share their experiences with surgery and chemo while\r\nshaping a vessel on the wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>            “It’s great\r\nto be with people who are going through the same things,” says Magde, 53, of\r\nIrondequoit. “A lot of have never done pottery before and make a million\r\nmistakes. But it challenges us to keep going and move on to new experiences. I\r\ncall it the Zen of letting go.” </p>","nativeImages":[{"id":"SW1hZ2UtMTA5MDk2","url":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/109910/posts/211814/image-109096-original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=560&v=1334951849&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=b478b9bfc06690ef410faccd00b9aeb5","__typename":"Image"},{"id":"SW1hZ2UtMTA5MDk3","url":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/109910/posts/211814/image-109097-original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=560&v=1334951948&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=13130f8e13e002d60c954ef841ac365b","__typename":"Image"}],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1334340014,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIwNzI3NQ==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Week 2 Backers: Thank you!","publishedAt":1334340014,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Genesee Pottery","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/331/136/40620ade7db11cb71c02bf7340bf26f7_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461381361&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=65f26d441b8f8eae3f233414e37f485b","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"Dania StewartTeresa HastingsCatherine JonesAdam WeilAmy RauClayton CowlesPhilip HellerShephen &amp; Leslie JacobsSarah ValleJosh DuttingerCathy &amp; Mike Thorpe<p>Julianna Drumheller</p>","nativeImages":[{"id":"SW1hZ2UtMTA3MTAy","url":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/109910/posts/207275/image-107102-original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=560&v=1334339761&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=8b136daabd8c18d3ed1b9a9217bd12b0","__typename":"Image"}],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1333738143,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTIwMzIyMg==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Huge thanks to our backers from Week 1:","publishedAt":1333738143,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Genesee Pottery","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/331/136/40620ade7db11cb71c02bf7340bf26f7_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461381361&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=65f26d441b8f8eae3f233414e37f485b","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Paul\r\n Lorenz, Charles Vorndran, Janette Heininger, Barbra Gorski, Travis  \r\nReeves, Cormac Farrell, Jeremy Crawford, Denise Pieratti, Matt Geise,  \r\nLaura Zinger, Robin Muto, Sheridan Vincent, Debbie Schoch, Bethany  \r\nKrull, Ingrid Lembach, Eloise Bennett, Meg Colombo, Marjorie Searl,  \r\nRebecca Johnson, Kate Money, Kabir de Lee Leeuw, Jane Zimmet, Linda Reilly, Jay English, and Robert Valdomar. </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1333115878,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"18000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"18537.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":199,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
