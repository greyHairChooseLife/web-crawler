The kiln shed is ready, the kiln is here, but the last step that I’m waiting on is for the Electrician to wire the kiln in. As the kiln is a high amperage and not a standard domestic electrical item, finding a suitable Electrician has been tricky. The wiring should be done in the next week or so, after which, I will start firing all of the items. All items are made and ready to fire.</p>\n<p>That being said, I’m conscious that the pledges were originally to be fulfilled in March 2021. As you already probably know, this sadly isn’t to be the case. Delays with building, fulfilment of key items and electrics have caused a short delay. I thought I could pull the old kiln through some last firings but sadly it wasn’t to be. It finally gave up a few weeks ago. I have found a specialist Kiln Engineer down in Essex who will take the old kiln off my hands to save me adding to landfill, and hopefully he can fix it for another potter to use in future. That kiln is being picked up tomorrow - the end of an era (and lots of stress).</p>\n<p>The revised date for fulfilment of rewards will now be end of April to early May. I can’t thank you enough for your patience and I can’t wait to start shipping items to you all!</p>\n<p>I have already been in touch with some of you about glaze and item choices, where the reward had options, so thank you to everyone who has replied.</p>\n<p>For those without options, I will be writing to you in the next week or so to request a delivery address. Keep an eye on your emails.</p>\n<p>Thanks again to you all, we are finally getting somewhere!</p>\n<p>Robynne, RMo Studio</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1633016173,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMxOTM5MzU=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"The end of the Kickstarter","publishedAt":1633016173,"pinnedAt":null,"number":5,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Robynne","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/624/293/2d88e6ed22c15bdd3a934d208256177c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1606940044&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=dee4b980eae9094a165ebac8d5b8f951","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1614535145,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMxMTQ4MDc=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"An update for project backers","publishedAt":1614535145,"pinnedAt":null,"number":3,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Robynne","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/624/293/2d88e6ed22c15bdd3a934d208256177c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1606940044&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=dee4b980eae9094a165ebac8d5b8f951","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":8,"commentsCount":1,"body":"<p>Hi everyone.
