I've been making and selling ceramics for a number of years, starting with a hobby and growing into a small business. I predominently work from my home studio, in my cellar - it's far from glamorous but it is a unique studio space that I am lucky to have access to.</p>\n<p>I've scaled up pottery production over the last year or so; setting up a new online store, selling my wares in shops around the UK, and taking on more commissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Pop-up in the Palmhouse, 2019\" data-id=\"31661422\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/661/422/e26fd84e7b028a0c1b03e1b2f5b676d2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1607250245&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=cef9caa8d5b73244613808ee417ab932\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pop-up in the Palmhouse, 2019</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">What am I</span> <span class=\"bold\">seeking funding for?</span></p>\n<p>My current kiln is second, third, possibly even fourth-hand, and after 3 years of continuous use, is sadly ready for retirement. She's an old gal - late 1980s, early 1990s - and I cannot stress how much I have worked the thing into the ground. It has been patched, rewired, and propped up more times than I can remember, but it has now sadly reached a point of no return. I need a new kiln so I can carry on RMo Studio.</p>\n<p>Kilns are very expensive things. Almost all of the money I make from pottery sales goes right back into studio running costs, kiln maintenance, and materials. I am therefore seeking support to purchase a new kiln, and continue the venture I love.</p>\n<p>After some research, I have estimated that the kiln I would need to continue running my store will cost just over £2,100. Professional installation has been quoted at another £200-£300. The additional amount included in the £2,500 Kickstarter goal accounts for payment processing fees and Kickstarter fees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If any funding is raised above and beyond the goal, this will go towards&nbsp;equipment for the the kiln (shelves, props, etc), much needed studio equipment, and construction of a small fire-proof, all-weather structure to house the kiln and ensure it remains safe from the elements, expected to cost around £1,000.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Selection of RMo Studio work\" data-id=\"31661517\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/661/517/b8fa3f6a83158a5683ca78e2d768613a_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1607251602&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=812dccb1143b322e56f7bbe522e3e5e0\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Selection of RMo Studio work</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It is a difficult thing for me to ask for support for my venture, especially in the current climate. After initially being reluctant to start a Kickstarter campaign, many of you have encouraged me to do this.&nbsp;This is a big ask, and I really appreciate any support offered; be that a purchase of a reward or sharing the project on social media.</p>\n<p>Anybody that has bought one of the more popular items from my online store will already know that these particular <span class=\"bold\">items are made to order,</span> a process which I will also apply to the products listed in this Kickstarter. This is all with a view to have a reliable kiln to fire items if the campaign is a success, and therefore no delays in future to order processing or sleepless nights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Rewards Available</span></p>\n<p>Rewards available will be for the popular RMo Studio items that I create, with some new options, such as allowing supporters to choose their own glaze.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Items purchased as a reward through the Kickstarter are slightly reduced from my usual prices.</p>\n<p>All available items are hardwearing stoneware, and will last for a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rewards will be ready in March 2021, and most are available with UK and worldwide shipping - so think of this as a pre-order of a lovely handmade item.</p>\n<p>After a very small shop update that has already been scheduled for Christmas, I will not be updating my store until all Kickstarter rewards are fulfilled. This means the Kickstarter is the only way to make a purchase directly from RMo Studio until after March 2021.</p>\n<br>\n<p>See my <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rmostudio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> for examples of some of the work that I create.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.marymaryflorals.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"RMo Studio vase with Mary Mary Florals dried bouquet\" data-id=\"31624160\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/031/624/160/c66682ad38343957ef3668c1b0ee4e1e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1606939229&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=44b51733bb212161b8263665967bac89\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">RMo Studio vase with Mary Mary Florals dried bouquet</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</a>\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Postage</span></p>\n<p>Due to the setup of Kickstarter, I can’t offer discount for postage if you want to pledge for more than one reward.
