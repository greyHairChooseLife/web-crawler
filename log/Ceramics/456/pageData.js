Unfortunately, through our own experience, currently available clay chimeneas on the market are often cheaply made allowing them to crack easily as they are unable to withstand prolonged or high heat.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"38077964\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/038/077/964/18d629fb2251ad1417a147aa6d383cb9_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1658853883&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=31c2be9e317c7c0633faf9016f13212f\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">That is why we decided to redesign the classic Chimenea into a product we can be proud of and one that you will cherish for years!</span></span></p>\n<p>After one and a half years of in-depth research, we successfully found and developed a new type of clay composition that is able to endure high heat and gain higher mechanical composition making our Clay Chimenea stronger and more durable while adhering to the traditional functionality and design.</p>\n<p>Maintaining the traditional style of the clay chimenea is essential to its functionality therefore we have chosen to produce our products in the Republic of Moldova (Eastern Europe). The reason behind this is to honour the tradition of Moldova's people in the ceramic industry, with their high level of expertise in clay production, to ensure each chimenea that leaves our production site exceeds your expectations.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"38077864\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/038/077/864/7dee75c8de4dba9dfcd5f6bc088f1cb1_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1658853346&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=27ba69a50578602cbea1e764bfaca650\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">The Design</span></p>\n<p>Handcrafted with care and attention, our Chiminea is an enclosed freestanding fireplace making it a safer alternative to traditional firepits as the fire remains enclosed within.
