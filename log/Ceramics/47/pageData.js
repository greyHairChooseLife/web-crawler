Originally I had planned to work with my study abroad students in Cortona who traveled across the world away from their homes. I had hoped to have them draw their memories of home and incorporate their drawings into a collaborative piece. Unexpectedly, the students were emergency evacuated from Italy when the US Department of State issued a Global Level 3 emergency: avoid all non-essential travel (to learn more see below—What am I doing in Italy?). This traumatic event has left me in Italy during a very uncertain time and has forced me to think about “home” in ways I had not expected.</p>\n<p>This twofold project involves continuing the collaboration with my students virtually, although conceptually it has been considerably altered, resulting in a series of plates that I will physically create in Cortona.</p>\n<p>As I personally tackle what it means to be truly “Stuck in Tuscany,” I am working on a series of commemorative plates about “home.” These plates will commemorate the places I have called home and the current place I am making home as I grapple with what it means to be unable to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"In-process work from the Cortona studio.\" data-id=\"28538945\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/538/945/06490d96a0ea63ba1d43368fd510f400_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1585227349&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=fb17fdd744193b277ab3e5ab94224704\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">In-process work from the Cortona studio.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:what-am-i-doing-in-i\" class=\"page-anchor\">What am I doing in Italy?</h1>\n<p>I came to Italy to teach ceramics for the University of Georgia on their study abroad campus in Cortona. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in northern Italy, we started an emergency evacuation of the students in the early morning of February 29. Within just 25 hours, the students had departed Cortona. The faculty chose to stay behind and wait for direction from our directors. Over the weeks that followed, the directors put forth a proposal to reunite us in Athens, Georgia to complete the studio courses.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival back to the US, the students were asked to self-isolate for 14-days. If I were to return, I knew I would be subjected to the same. I decided to wait for approval and relocate directly to Athens and continue teaching there post self-isolation. This never happened. As COVID-19 begun to take over the United States, the University of Georgia wisely decided to put courses online for the remainder of the term.</p>\n<p>This turn of events left me in Cortona, Italy, during a time when the U.S. Department of State issued a Global Level 4 Health Advisory— stating Do NOT Travel. After carefully weighing my options, I am certain it is safer to stay put and not travel at this time. It was not an easy decision, but as a high-risk person with an autoimmune disease, it would not be worth the risk of exposure.</p>\n<p>I am now the last remaining faculty member in Cortona. I was recently directed to move out of my little apartment on the north wall of the city. I am now living in a dorm room on the UGA Cortona campus, where I am self-isolating for an indefinite amount of time. Thankfully, on campus, I have access to wifi and a ceramic studio at my disposal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"28538757\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/538/757/e2af2e587e8e71890468c981dd41d731_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1585226107&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5a6bf152598335d199c24c4ac270f679\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:project-detail\" class=\"page-anchor\">&nbsp;Project Detail &gt; &gt; &gt;</h1>\n<p>For the first part of this project, I am working with my students, who have been forced to return to their homes in the US due to COVID-19.This project has evolved into a collaboration about our collective experiences being forced from our home and each other. We are now working together to develop imagery, patterns, and a design for the project. We are doing this through video calls, independent sketching, and collaborative drawings. I will transfer our final design and composition to a series of 25 plates, which represent the mere 25 hours the students were given to leave Cortona.</p>\n<p>The second part of the project is my personal exploration of “home.” Over the past five years and since finishing graduate school, I have lived in 25 different places. During my remaining time in Italy, I am going to complete a set of plates that explore my questions about home. I’ve been thinking a lot about how we inhabit spaces and turn them into meaningful places. For example, I am deeply drawn to doors, both as beautiful objects and as gateways that lead into private spaces. I am specifically interested in exploring the following questions: “What does it mean to be forced away from your home?” “What does it mean to stay home?” “How long does it take for a place to become home?” “Is home a place or an idea?” “Is home where the heart is?” “How does the idea of home change over a life-span?” \"What is home if you don’t have one?\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Newspaper article about the emergency evacuation.\" data-id=\"28538709\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/538/709/e0322337ee59fb8f6fdfcfc6fa194931_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1585225701&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b9f00a9c16aa0f466b451cd993488bd7\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Newspaper article about the emergency evacuation.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:why\" class=\"page-anchor\">Why?</h1>\n<p>In addition to this amazing project and all the reasons I talked about above, I am also doing this campaign because of my hardships due to COVID-19. One of my biggest challenges is that after the completion of my course (in April) I cannot legally work in Italy. Until this pandemic is behind us, I do not anticipate being able to return to the States, because of my health as a person with a compromised immune system. I will be in Italy “indefinitely,” which is hopefully only a few months, but this is completely out of my control. My hope is that the funds from this campaign will get me through my time in Italy and help me restart when I get back to the States. The silver lining is that additional time in Cortona will allow me to continue working in the studio with a purpose and sharing what I love with all of you.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Example of past Commemorative Plates from the Commemorate Macon Series\" data-id=\"28538651\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/538/651/e3dfee2352c6758bf194b74c6dc96a18_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1585225121&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=af1ba9310c47dc0ce0d0c17eb8f5336c\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Example of past Commemorative Plates from the Commemorate Macon Series</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:rewards\" class=\"page-anchor\">Rewards &gt; &gt; &gt;</h1>\n<p>While you may find the rewards a little funny and lighthearted, I can assure you that I am taking this project seriously.

From a slender but tall house on the outside wall of the city to the UGA Cortona Campus. She is in the midst of doing something she didn’t even know was possible—teaching ceramics online. \r\n\r\nHer spirit animal is the cat. Her favorite film of all time is Babette's Feast. She is on day 165 of studying Spanish on Duolingo and started Italian last week. Better late than never. Her astrological sign is Aquarius. She is an aunt to four little girls under the age of five. She has never said no to an Abba dance party. She is an avid reader and most recently finished My Brilliant Friend and is in the midst of reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for the second time. Her perfect breakfast would include purple potatoes. She has donated over 12 inches of her hair to Wigs for Kids five times. Her hair is currently the shortest it has been since she was eight when her mom gave her a bowl hair cut because she refused to brush her hair. Twenty-seven years later and she still doesn’t like to brush her hair. Her favorite foods in alphabetical order are balsamic vinegar, cheese, eggplant, strawberry, heirloom tomato, watermelon, and wine.\r\n\r\nIn her past life, when she wasn’t making things in clay or teaching ceramics you could probably have found her walking in the woods, working in the garden, or in the kitchen where she was making and sharing food with friends or possibly strangers. In her new life, she has added to the list swing dancing, traveling, rock climbing, practicing Spanish in Italy, watching films, eating Baci chocolate, crocheting, and allowing time to do nothing.
