Basically, you'll have a chemical analysis of a puddle (the mud at the bottom of a puddle) sent to me, and I'll reverse engineer the chemical analysis of that puddle and send you a glaze recipe for it so that you may recreate it chemically using common glaze materials. All I'll need is for you to send me the address or GPS location of the puddle and an image of it or you with it so that it can be appropriately documented. </p>\n\n<p>Here's how it works: You'll send Acme Labs in Vancouver, Canada a 100g sample of the puddle you would like to have a glaze recipe for. When you back the project I'll send you the form that you'll send them, it will be all filled out minus your personal information (you add that in) and you'll print that form and send it to Acme along with your 100 gram puddle sample and the analysis fee (roughly $25). This will need to happen ASAP after you back the project because it can take as long as 8 weeks to get the analysis to come back. But when it does, the analysis will be sent to you and to me as well and I will formulate you a glaze recipe from it. </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer - There's no way know beforehand if your glaze will be food safe or what temperature it will fire to, but I will be able to let you know that information after the reverse engineering. However, I am yet to develop a puddle glaze which is not at least intriguing with great sculptural potential.</p>\n\n<p>Your glaze and recipe will be pictured and listed as a collaboration between you and I in the Mobile Anagama Photobook, you'll be listed a as a supporter in the book, and you'll be kept up to date on the kiln and its tour as it happens.

As I began to realize the bureaucratic hurdles that were sure to impede the actual building of such a large and permanent structure, I was offered my family's old utility trailer and I began to develop concepts for a mobile kiln. Knowing I would need interest and financial support for the ceramics community if it was to be a success, I proposed and received a 2014 NCECA Graduate Student Fellowship which awarded 2000$ to build “The Mobile Anagama”.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"- Design originally submitted to NECEA.

The new purpose built steal frame resting on a 6000 pound capacity axle with electric breaks and sweet 8ply heavy duty trailer tries will more than adequately carry the future kiln. However, as a result the grant money has ran out. I raised an additional 1000$ with a Puddle Glaze Pottery Sale (more on puddle glazing to come) and now that has ran out as well and I need your support if it is going to be ready to fire at its first scheduled event on July 25th as a finale to the Summer School ceramics programs here in Alfred.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"- Once the kiln is assembled, loaded, and ready to fire, the scene might look something like this... -\" data-caption=\"- Once the kiln is assembled, loaded, and ready to fire, the scene might look something like this... -\" data-id=\"2162120\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"- Once the kiln is assembled, loaded, and ready to fire, the scene might look something like this... -\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/162/120/b36f7ff3440d9c5cea1e8bbc27f22380_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1403107253&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d0fa26063cedcda6e2598c49bb7ac3ab\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">- Once the kiln is assembled, loaded, and ready to fire, the scene might look something like this... -</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:the-tour\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">**THE TOUR**</span></h1><p>Leaving from Alfred immediately following the first firing, the kiln will head to Detroit and westward from there.

The form of the kiln will then be assembled and stilted on a wedge on the kiln floor. The Kiln's bricks are stored while in transit inside padded benches with pieces of carpet between each one to protect them from grinding against each one another. The bricks, each cast and labeled for their specific location, will then be removed and placed appropriately over the kiln form with the bottom layer fitted into the channel steal that outlines the kiln floor. When the arch is entirely constructed the wedge under the form is removed and the kiln form can then be removed from the arch. After the arch is in place, the grate bars can be inserted (they allow air to pass under and threw the burning wood by suspending large pieces off the kiln floor), and a layer of 1” thick refractory insulation fiber blanket is then laid over the entire kiln exterior. The stainless steal seething that protects the exterior can then be attached to the corresponding hooks on the steal arches that cap each end of the kiln (at the entrance to the chimney and at the front gate). At this point kiln the shelves and wares or whatever it is that is being fired can be loaded into the kiln until it is as full as desired. The kiln door comprised of large bricks cast specifically for the respective locations are stored in their own padded boxes during transit similarly to the arch bricks, and they can now be put into place as the kiln's front door. The kiln is then ready to fire which depending on weather, its contents, the fuel, the time constraints, and the goals of the firing, could take as little as 8 hours to reach temperature and a face cord of wood to fuel. To dissemble the kiln these steps are essentially followed in reverse order.

This “Puddle Glazing” as I'm calling it, is an idea that spawned from research into Korean Onggi pottery which described the use of naturally wetted earth surface material with decaying organic matter as their glaze source. And I thought, “You mean a puddle?!” It is an idea that has emerged for me as a meaningful and practical source for glaze material, speaking to the unexpected functional potential of refuse and highlighting the individuality of each place's nuanced chemical composition. By gathering mud and water from seven local puddles in Alfred, NY as well as one sample from the Detroit River, I have fired them on their own, fired them having ball milled them and sieved them, and I have chemically analyzed them and reverse engineered those analyses to develop glaze recipes using commonly available glaze materials to chemically replicate them. This research has not only generated a wide verity of functional glazes that have been a personal joy to use, but it has served as an amazing teaching tool and perfect point of access for individuals to become interested and involved in my practice.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -\" data-caption=\"- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -\" data-id=\"2135164\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/135/164/4491b0ad2a47de239c97262e23ca9e11_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1402545677&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c163370c5c495898598f800895a7501f\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>\t&nbsp;With this first very formal scientific aspect of my puddle glazing research complete, The Mobile Anagama will be the perfect opportunity to share those results and to collect and fire attentional samples along the way. By cross analyzing geological survey maps I'll be able to make predictions regarding the viscosity, applications and color of each glaze as well as comparisons after each puddles chemical analysis. But that's the thing, each chemical analysis is going to cost 25$ and if any additional funds are raised as a result of this Kickstarter, those analyzes is what it will go toward.</p><p>After the tour I hope to share the experience and this puddle glaze information as an article published in a ceramics periodical and I will feature writings, Images, glaze recipes, more thoroughly in the “Mobile Anagama” Photobook that I'll be putting together as the reward for donations of 100 dollars or more.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -\" data-caption=\"- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -\" data-id=\"2135162\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/135/162/aaaef1e69827fb6853ae35b4b7679b64_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1402545567&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=31cb3d789d9fe60b56a44676fc79a437\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">- Puddle Glazed Cups, electric fired to cone 10, 2014 -</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:the-rewards\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">**THE REWARDS**</span></h1><p>As I'm sure you've noticed, the rewards are listed on the right side of the page.
