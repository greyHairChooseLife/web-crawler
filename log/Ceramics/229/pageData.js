I'm a ceramicist and a ceramic artist :) I've been designing and creating ceramics for over a decade now and my passion has slowly become a business. I consider myself very lucky being able to do something I love every day!</p><p>Over the years I've produced many pieces with different themes such as Toothless, My Little Pony, Disney characters and rainbow designs, but specialising in commissions. Getting to flex my artistic muscles over a custom design is what really gets me going! I thrive on challenge and the greatest satisfaction for me is producing something that my client falls in love with :3&nbsp; </p><p>Although being a ceramic artist is fun and challenging, it does have its pitfalls and sources of stress. It's been a very slow process building up the business as equipment in this field is pretty expensive. The most expensive being a kiln, which is needed to fire each ceramic piece I paint to lock in the painted colours and make them all waterproof, food safe etc. I have yet to come across another furry artist who uses paint and ceramic as a medium (which is pretty cool that my art is unique) but it means that what I do is fairly misunderstood and my work tends to be overlooked in favor of digital art. I really want to be successful in my venture and I want to share what I love with all of you! So with that in mind -</p><p>I am super excited to share with you my newest project which I'm calling 'Mugsonas'! These are mugs painted to look like your fursona! The example shown in the project photo is a Mugsona of my furry character, Starla. I use reference sheets and existing art of a fursona to create colorful and unique renditions of your character!</p><p>I am offering a few different pledge options including matching fursona coasters! All pledgers and I will plan a design together to make absolutely sure that you are all happy with your Mugsona! I will livestreaming most of the work done so you will be given the opportunity to watch me working on this project, as well as posting regular photo updates to my various social medias :D </p><p>I am so very grateful to all of my lovely pledgers - your support is massively appreciated and keeps me able to do what I love, every day. Thank you so much all!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Physical art is not a sure thing and the ceramic world can be volatile! The only real risk for this project is the same risk I run every time I pop a finished piece in the kiln to be fired - it may not make it out in one piece. \r\nHowever, as this is a risk I have endured for my whole career as a ceramic artist (and ceramicist), I have a strict policy - anything that breaks gets immediately remade. So you as pledgers have nothing to worry about whatsoever! Regardless as to what happens on my end of things, pledgers will be well-communicated with and will receive their gifts!</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xNTkwNDY0Njcx","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":0,"number_of_comments_depth_all":1,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nI design & paint furry & MLP ceramic pieces such as mugs, bowls & plates among other things :3 All pieces are food safe & microwavable!\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/018/279/446/8c33038d2f2e62b30dca5b2b9fc224dd_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1505138479&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=7e7bd64086e0c68eddf001ef734d4bd0","last_updated":"October 2, 2017","project_name":"ugsonas!
