(my latest one sold out in 20 minutes, <span class=\"text-italic\">crazy right?!</span>)</p>\n<p>During Covid-19 times, my full-time work ended, without furlough and I'm not entitled to any government support (one of those who fell through the cracks!) - I know my situation isn't anywhere near as bad as some, but during this time I've scaled up making pottery, and see that it could be a full time career (<span class=\"bold\">the dream!</span>).</p>\n<p>Up until recently, I have been a member at<span class=\"bold\"> 7 Spot Pottery in Salford, UK</span> (would HIGHLY recommend their classes - once they're back to 'normal') - but without a job, I ate into all of my 'wheel dream' savings and had to return the wheel they were renting out to me. In short - I don't have a pottery wheel and other basic pottery bits to make any <span class=\"text-italic\">'wheel thrown'</span> pottery!</p>\n<p>The target amount is for a pottery wheel, clay, new glazes, new paintbrushes, packaging and to cover the Kickstarter fees, this will help me to continue making fun, bright and beautiful ceramics indefinitely! I bought a small kiln before lockdown so this is really all I need to carry on making! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of the rewards above £5 are all handmade ceramic items, lovingly made by <span class=\"bold\">ME!</span> Once everything arrives (fingers crossed we hit the target!) I'll get straight to making the rewards. <span class=\"bold\">So, it's just like you're pre-ordering pottery!</span></p>\n<p>I have included my most popular items in the rewards. I've also made it possible to buy 'sets' of mugs - <span class=\"bold\">in 2's and 4's</span> - something I don't do on Etsy!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading this far, and I'd be super grateful if you'd consider pledging and in return (depending on what you select) you'll get some lovingly crafted pottery!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Go browse my <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/freckleandfernceramics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/freckleandfernceramics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Page</a> for ideas of previous work.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The risks involved with trying to get this money via crowdfunding, is that we might not reach the target! I really hope that you guys can help out and in return, you'll get some handmade pottery from me. \n\nI don't foresee any problems in stock levels of the wheel or clay I would be buying - I have been in touch with the wheel supplier and they are confident they'll be able to fulfil my order request quickly! This means as soon as it arrives, I can get straight to it! There are also many wheel and clay suppliers throughout the UK - if one doesn't have what I'm after - I'm sure another company will! :)</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMDczNjAxNTMw","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":2,"number_of_comments_depth_all":4,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nPledging will help me to continue to make pottery.
