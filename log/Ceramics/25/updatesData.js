While our new studio is sweet and quaint, it's capacity for in-person browsing and events is much more limited that our previous studio of 6 years. With the risks of Covid-19 dwindling, we're looking forward to hosting gatherings once again. Our goal is to build out our attic above the studio so that we can hold workshops and events that feel more comfortable and spacious.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We are aiming raising $20K to transform the attic of our studio into a creative space for events and workshops. If we meet our goal, will receive a 1:1 funding match from MGCC (Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation) for a total of $40K. Wowzer!!</p>\n<br>\n<p>This is an all-or-nothing campaign, so we're truly relying on our friends, followers and family to help us spread the word.</p>\n<br>\n<p>What we are offering you, <em><strong>the ones who first believed in us, who got us started, who launched the start of our success</strong></em>...we're offering you double the rewards when you pledge to our <a href=\"https://www.patronicity.com/project/tandem_ceramics_builds_out_the_attic#!/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patronicity Campaign</a>.

Which brings us to our next point…all your rewards were made with this sweet piece of soft-brick-and-stainless-steel-sheathing-computerized-goodness! We had enough money for the kiln, the wiring, a dry materials lab (an unexpected bonus!), and all the materials to make your rewards and ship them out to you. So hopefully they have arrived, and if you haven't gotten your reward, its probably because you need to tell us where you live a.k.a. fill out the survey we sent you :) But seriously, let us know if you haven't gotten it yet.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Justine with the rewards in progress, waiting for the kiln to be installed...\" data-caption=\"Justine with the rewards in progress, waiting for the kiln to be installed...\" data-id=\"4118440\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Justine with the rewards in progress, waiting for the kiln to be installed...\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/118/440/b97c50e39bea98116404f0dc00fc032f_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1436406131&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2a988c05e550b9a9a466029feb6aacae\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Justine with the rewards in progress, waiting for the kiln to be installed...</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>We want to thank you all for your patience in receiving your rewards.

It was a major learning lesson in planning that...a) things always seem to take a bit longer than anticipated and...b) you can't always foresee what trial and error lies ahead! To give you a little window into the issues we encountered…</p><p>• the kiln company takes the month of January off, so the ordering of our kiln was postponed for a month</p><p>• and then it took longer than estimated...a good three weeks longer</p><p>• once it came and was wired, we discovered many issues with our clay and glaze that somehow had managed to go undetected previously. There was glaze running, bubbling, cracking, and many sad faces were made by us :(</p><p>• then our printer for the decals died…more sadness. We got another one though :)</p><p>We prevailed through it all to bring you your rewards! And we cannot thank you enough. We seriously would not have been able to do this without y'all.</p><p>NOW ONTO THE HAPPY!</p><p>We are pleased to announce that we have made some huge strides towards getting Tandem Ceramics off the ground. We received a mini-grant through Mass MOCA in North Adams, MA to have a new website built for us. It will be launched in August, and will allow people to buy from us directly.
