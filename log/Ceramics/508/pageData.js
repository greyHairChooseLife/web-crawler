I am in a shop in LA and i have art displayed in shops all over the world. I would like to expand my business and hopefully open up my own shop. Ive been contacted by numerous websites to sell my gnomes. Im also in the works of getting my gnomes mass produced in the United Kingdom. Ive been working with the same boring mold, so the funds would also help create a new personalized ian the gnome mold. I have people who have held molding classes in colleges and they are more than willing to help me create and produce a new mold. I feel like this will help me create a wider variety and hopefully expand the market. In the past few months i have purchased all the gnomes that were available causing a back order for 2 months. This is my full time job now so i want to avoid that happening again and i feel making my own mold would eliminate that problem and immediately benefit ian the gnome and expand the business.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I feel like i have a firm grip on everything in my control. Other than shipping accidents or potential breakages i feel like a successfully funded project would do nothing but improve my company. I think the toughest obstacle would be getting a shop and running it. I am extremely ambitious and im currently doing what i love to do.  When youre doing what you love to do you will find a way to continue to do it. I am not giving up on this project regardless. Its more of a passion than a project.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":2,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A custom hand painted gnome from Ian the gnome signed</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-11-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Nov 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n2 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (18 left of 20)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Hand painted gnome and an Ian the gnome t-shirt with ian the gnome pins</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-11-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Nov 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (10 left of 10)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>"],"number_of_FAQ":"0","number_of_updates":"0","number_of_comments_depth_all":"0","contents_of_FAQ":[],"last_updated":"August 3, 2014"}
