ALL the kitties have been made and are going through the final glazing, YAY! A few kitties had issues, so those have been remade and are also being glazed. I still have about 30 hours of glazing left and will be pushing to get those fired this weekend, boxed and shipped by the 30th. All boxes should arrive first week of May ðŸ’• Considering how we made the Kickstarter goal 4 times over and went $3000 past the total expected amount with extra, unplanned kitties, Iâ€™m really happy to be getting these done so close to the original goal.Â </p>\n<p>I want to thank you all so so much for your support and patience. I received so much more support for this Kickstarter then I ever anticipated and I means the world to me. Especially having so many shows canceled at this time, it has been a saving grace.

The studio has been taken over by cute cats! (Its amazing). I'm getting very close to sending out the first batch of orders. Which means, if you have not filled out the Kickstarter survey, please take a moment to locate it in your inbox. It was sent on February 24th, if that helps to find it.Â </p>\n<p><strong>Health precautions after receiving your package...</strong> a March 17th study by The New England Journal of Medicine shows that COVID-19 can last on cardboard for 24 hours and non-pores surfaces (like ceramics) for up to 3 days. Packages are best kept outside for a day, if possible. Sunlight has been shown to help kill the virus as well. After a day the cardboard is safe. I am taking every health precaution, <em>but </em>to be safe please resist unpacking your order for 3 days past the post date on the box. (For some of you the package will spend enough time in transit to be safe after one day.) These extra steps will ensure your order is healthy and happy. All ceramics are also safe to disinfect. Â </p>\n<p><strong>About</strong> <strong>Local Pick Up...</strong> If you have already filled out your survey and opted for local pick up, all orders will have to be shipped. I'll miss seeing you at Ceramic Showcase which has been canceled.Â </p>\n<p>Stay happy, healthy and well everyone!Â </p>\n<p>- Carrie Kitzke (artist) and Mimmi (cat boss)Â </p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Magnets are ready!
