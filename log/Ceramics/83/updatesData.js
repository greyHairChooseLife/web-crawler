We may also be moving to a more suitable location soon as time plays out and life comes back in again.

(Oh no! What happened!??</p>\n<p>This update will be addressing some important issues I have come across as well as the progress we have seen. This update would bring everyone up to date on things regardless if you follow me on Instagram or only hear from me through these updates.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>The First Cycle of Firing!</strong></p>\n<p>We have successfully cycled through the first complete firing without any issues to the kiln. Nabertherm has worked wonders as a brand I've known since my studies at NAFA. The kiln boasts optimum operation at low electricity usage as kiln goes.  I can't wait for more opportunities to fire in this lovely small Top-45 kiln.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>The Rewards have been delayed.</strong></p>\n<p>This month of April marks the first estimated delivery of rewards for most of the project backers. Unfortunately, I have encountered some very bad people who supplied me some very bad clay. To keep the story short, I have been duped by a local supplier here in Malaysia. I had asked for a clay which matures at 1200'c and was given a clay which matures at a much higher temperature. Unbeknownst to myself, I had misplaced my trust in this supplier and worked hard over the past month and a half to produce all of the reward pieces only to find out my efforts were wasted. Having done a glaze firing to test for glazes at 1200'c , I discovered to my horror that my test tiles made of clay were not matured and worse still, acted as bisque ware as it took in water.</p>\n<p>Currently I am trying to contact the supplier to rectify this mishap in hopes that it was a mistake on their part.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the situation,  I would humbly ask to seek for your understanding in this matter as I work on the rewards a second time.<strong> I will be aiming to deliver the works by JUNE.</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Its not all bad news!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aside</strong> from the problems with the clay, there are good news to be shared. During this period, a few local businesses have approached us to have a collaboration of sorts. This works perfectly into building a community around <strong>Giants Little Pottery</strong> and also adds to cover our operation costs. These collaborations are still in discussion but I do hope for things to go well from here on out! We have also started fiddling with the thought of creating a funding meter as a capital to open up our studio in a shophouse setting. Perhaps a percentage of any earning we make, be it through sales or collaboration will be funneled into this fund and who knows, we may be the very first modern-ish studio there is here in Malaysia? (Fingers crossed)</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much!</strong></p>\n<p>For those few who have reached out to me through Instagram during the unfolding horror, thank you.</p>\n<p>I have been down from the realization of my wasted works as the thought of lost time befalls on me. However, I am definitely giving it my best once again as this is for you lovely people. My indirect board of directors who made my studio a reality and I am working to make you proud.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Again, follow me on instagram to discover my latest news.
