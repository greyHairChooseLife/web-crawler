Sorry to hear you didn’t receive it. I sent it to the second address you gave me after we last spoke and hadn’t heard from you so just assumed it arrived okay. I think since we are having such trouble getting it to you, maybe us just sending you a refund would work best? Let me know if this would work for you. I’m very sorry - would really have liked for you to receive the piece, but after three failed attempts it doesn’t make sense to try mailing it again.","createdAt":1562455401,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xMDIzMjQyOTQx","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/604/096/a76b6aef13107a1bb6e81ae2a0ce2391_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1501597137&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=4bd5615c3b7e19d7bf288f3f897c3d4c","name":"Emma Smith","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1023242941"}}]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0xOTcyODY2Ng==","body":"Do you have a link to the backer kit?
