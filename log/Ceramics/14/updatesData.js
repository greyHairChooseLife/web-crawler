For those who signed up for \"Light it up\" we'll be in touch over the course of the year for kiln space in the firings. Don't worry, we'll be giving you ample notice! But start filling those ware boards!</p><p>Thanks again (so much!) for all the support, for helping us complete this project, and for your patience.
