We also believe in the confidence that an all or nothing funding\nmodel can lend to you the investor. It is not possible for us to accomplish our\ngoals with only a few supporters, but rather a community willing to step\nforward and believe in us.

This special kiln must be easily opened and allow access to remove the red hot pots from the kiln. Once removed the glowing pottery is placed in metal containers with combustibles, such as paper or saw dust, in order to reduce the atmosphere surrounding the pots and create distinct markings and color variations in the glaze. \n<br>The entire process of firing the wares to temperature, removing from the kiln and cooling back down to room temperature takes only an hour or two allowing participants to see immediate results and leave with a finished piece of glazed pottery. \n<br>Traditional Raku firing was developed in 16th century Japan and has been adapted by potters since then to accommodate modern materials and aesthetics.

This is the method of finishing wares that is most prevalent in my body of work. \n<br>Soda firing involves placing either glazed or unglazed pottery in the kiln by stacking the wares so that the flame can move around the pots carrying with it sodium vapors. In order to visualize how the flame travels through the kiln it is easiest to think about a stream flowing down a mountain, the water will always follow the path of least resistance. As a soda fire potter I work to manage this path and create distinct patterns and colors on the surface of my work. \n<br>The sodium is introduced to the kiln when a temperature of around 2300 degrees F is reached. A mixture of soda ash and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are used to soda fire. There are a few ways to place the soda into the kiln, I prefer to use a dry mix that is thrown in with  'burritos' to land directly in the firebox where the flame enters the kiln.\n<br>Once the sodium has been introduced to the kiln it slowly turns to vapor and begins its journey through the kiln, moving through the pots to make it's way to the kiln's flue where the flame exits the chamber. The sodium is very corrosive and slowly erodes the surface of the pottery to expose the silica within the clay. The silica then melts to form the beautiful blue/green glaze that can be found on the surface of soda fired wares. \n<br>There is a great deal of further nuance and detail that goes into creating distinct soda glazed pottery. If you have further interest in discussing this with me please feel free to send me a message.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"type-12 navy-500 mb3\">\nLast updated: <time datetime=\"2016-03-30T14:49:46-04:00\" data-format=\"llll z\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Thu, March 31 2016 3:49 AM UTC +09:00</time>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>","<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_167706\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"167706\" href=\"#project_faq_167706\" name=\"project_faq_167706\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nWho is Helenske Clayworks?\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>Helenske Clayworks is the business name under which Adam markets his hand made pottery.

This early experience gave me an understanding of craftsmanship and showed me the joy of creating objects with my hands. I continued working with clay through the early years of my youth and transitioned to doing more printmaking and drawing during high school. \n<br>When I graduated high school I enrolled in college, but did not have a clear understanding of what I wanted to study and pursue in my life. I eventually enrolled in the visual art program at Minnesota State University Moorhead with the intent of studying graphic design. During my first three semesters I found myself spending the majority of my time in the ceramics and sculpture studios. When I did work on my graphic design projects I was always working with packaging and other 3-dimensional projects. \n<br>During my second year in the college of arts my brother graduated high school and enrolled as a ceramics major at a neighboring university. I had been questioning my true desire to work in graphic design and my brother's commitment to clay was the catalyst I needed to follow my dreams and pursue a degree in ceramics. \n<br>I appreciate my experience and time spent working with graphic design as it gave me valuable tools that I still use in my marketing, but more importantly it allowed me to see that I would be working extremely hard to be successful in any career I followed. This gave me the understanding I needed to commit myself to pottery and to push forward in accomplishing my dreams of working creatively with my hands and sharing my knowledge and skills with others through teaching.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"type-12 navy-500 mb3\">\nLast updated: <time datetime=\"2016-03-31T12:23:21-04:00\" data-format=\"llll z\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Fri, April 1 2016 1:23 AM UTC +09:00</time>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"],"project_description":"\nWe are installing kilns & pottery wheels to expand our class offerings allowing kids & adults to explore clay within our studio.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/666/941/8d4e03053e8e6b3eb560e4de28762b31_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463686518&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=42756e0098c0a180aaf5ffef70e9d7da","last_updated":"January 4, 2017","project_name":"t's Clay Time with Helenske Claywork","pledgedOrigin":"$19,000","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"18,000","amount_of_pledged":"19,000","rate_of_funded":105,"number_of_backers":"124","project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Seattle, WA","top_cities_location_1st":"Seattle United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"44","top_cities_location_2st":"Fargo United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"19","top_cities_location_3st":"Moorhead United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"5","top_cities_location_4st":"Portland United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"4","top_cities_location_5st":"Bellingham United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"3","top_cities_location_6st":"Bismarck United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"2","top_cities_location_7st":"Grand Forks United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"2","top_cities_location_8st":"Minneapolis United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"2","top_cities_location_9st":"Minot United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"2","top_cities_location_10st":"Plymouth United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"2","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"120","top_countries_location_2st":"Canada","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_countries_location_3st":"Spain","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_countries_location_4st":"Switzerland","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","number_of_new_backers":86,"number_of_returning_backers":38,"creator_name":"Circle of Art Studios","creator_location":"Seattle, WA","creator_description":"Adam Helenske is co-owner of Circle of Art Studios, LLC.
