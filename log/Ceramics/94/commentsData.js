Yes,  all of the bowls will be of a similar size.  To be honest, we haven't worked out all the pick-up details yet, but we will likely set out all the bowls and let our backers pick out the one they want.  The bowls will be randomly selected for those backers who are getting their bowls shipped.","createdAt":1650491166,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xODI4NDIzMzQ4","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/407/291/954d52d0d85373065445892c94486279_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1645224176&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=bd0f7b6cfd06fc1c9f871114db9eed4a","name":"Edmonton Potters' Guild","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/edmontonpottersguild"}}]}}}]
