Over our history, our potters have created thousands of pots that have been sent out into the world to be used and enjoyed by others. As potters who create functional wares, one of our greatest joys is knowing that our pots get lovingly filled and placed on a table that is surrounded by friends and family.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\" Just one of the many beautiful pots made at the EPG studio on any given day.\" data-id=\"36991305\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/991/305/14d0205deb5982343ae3242f04f8790f_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1649966379&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=03fed22647348ea113da22e0244109db\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\"> Just one of the many beautiful pots made at the EPG studio on any given day.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n<p>For the past two years, our guild has been navigating the choppy waters of what life in a pottery studio looks like during a pandemic. Cultivating and nurturing our community amidst masking mandates, capacity limits, and concerns over keeping our members healthy and safe has been a challenge. We miss one another, and we miss sending our pots out into the world for others to experience and enjoy.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Typically vibrant, boisterous, and full of people, the EPG studio has been a very different place these last 2 years. \" data-id=\"36656837\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/656/837/079ab4bc52c37ac059fce01da202f396_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1647299038&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=c93542903ec6bc2377ea9a96e9f6b450\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Typically vibrant, boisterous, and full of people, the EPG studio has been a very different place these last 2 years. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n<p>And so, we have launched the 100 Bowl Project. The aim of this project is to bring back a sense of community, both for our guild members, and for those who gather around our bowls.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"The EPG 100 bowl project aims to strengthen our community, one beautiful bowl at a time.\" data-id=\"36511149\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/511/149/2e1301fe9b06a918dbf67590890983bc_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1646158103&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f4378d458098125b19bd890e2d8f0518\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The EPG 100 bowl project aims to strengthen our community, one beautiful bowl at a time.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Every bowl produced for this project will be unique, and will be created through the collective effort of our guild members. No single potter will create a single bowl from start to finish. Rather, our community of potters will come together to contribute to each stage of the making, from the throwing and trimming, to the firing and glazing. In the end, patrons will have a bowl that symbolizes the collective passion of our community, and will be a reflection of the many hands that contributed to its making. It is our hope that these bowls will become treasured pieces of functional art that will be used to bring friends and family together as we navigate our way out of this pandemic.</p>\n<p>The finished size of each bowl will range between 9-11 inches (23-28 cm) in diameter and 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in height.</p>\n<br>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Timeline:</span></p>\n<p>● <span class=\"bold\">May-October: </span>It takes some time to make pottery - each piece must be thrown on the wheel, trimmed, fired, glazed, and then fired again. Because our members are not production potters, and our studio has a limited amount of space in our kiln, we will produce the 100 bowls over a period of 6 months. The bowls will come to life during a series of \"bowl-throwing working bees\" that will be held once a month, beginning in May and running through to October. &nbsp;At these working bees, our members will come together to share ideas, knowledge, and experiences as they produce your bowl. These bowls will truly be a community effort, and will reflect the collective passion and artistry of our members.</p>\n<p>● <span class=\"bold\">November: </span>Bowls will be ready for local pick-up at our south Edmonton studio during a number of specified pick-up dates. You will be notified via email about the pick-up dates sometime in early November. &nbsp;For those who select the shipping within Canada option, the bowls will be packed and shipped in early November.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"36991333\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/036/991/333/c3617c87304f64ece1596445c1feac2c_original.JPEG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1649966471&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=0a7a9b12c4cde8c5547022f406981486\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Random is what random does:\n\nAs a backer, you are not commissioning us to make you a bowl to your exact specifications. Instead, this campaign is about trust and the joy of surprise. You won't get to pick your bowl, or tell us what colour you want your bowl to be. You will get a bowl from us, sight unseen, which will be randomly selected from the 100 that we make.  While some may think this is \"risky\", we think it's just part of the fun! But, there is a risk that as someone who really dislikes the colour blue, you might get a bowl that is blue - but in time, you might come to really, really love that blue bowl.  If you don't, you can always gift it to your friend who loves blue :)\n\nLocal pick-up:\n\nThose who opt for the local pick-up option will be required to come and pick-up their bowl at our south Edmonton studio.  We will be offering a number of pick-up times, and we hope that you will be able to make it, but let's face it, life is sometimes a bit crazy. If you aren't able to make our designated pick-up times, don't worry - we will work with you to make sure we find a time for you to come and get your bowl.\n\nShipping:\n\nWe have a limited number of bowls available for shipping within Canada only. These bowls will be packaged and sent to our backers in November 2022 and will be sent via Canada Post Regular Parcel delivery service. While we will be sure to package your bowl very carefully, there is always a risk of breakage during shipping. The Edmonton Potters' Guild will not be responsible for any breakage that occurs during shipping and no refunds will be provided if a bowl breaks during transport.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0zNTk0ODM3NTA=","number_of_FAQ":1,"number_of_updates":8,"number_of_comments_depth_all":7,"contents_of_FAQ":["<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_394662\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"394662\" href=\"#project_faq_394662\" name=\"project_faq_394662\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nHow do I order more than one bowl?\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>If you are interested in getting more than one bowl, you can add an additional $100 (or $135 for those you want shipped in Canada) as a \"bonus support\" payment.
