Autumn always brings with it a palpable sense of change in rhythm, and as we settle back into \"more regular\" life at the studio, we are also able to reflect on what we have collectively achieved with the 100 Bowl Project over the last 6 months. </p>\n<p>To be honest, progress on this project felt a bit slow at the beginning - it was hard to actually see what we were accomplishing when the bowls were in  their various stages of production. But now, after all these months, the progress is undeniable.  The most obvious sign that we have been working towards something remarkable is the giant stack of bowls that you see when you walk into the studio.  And, every Monday, when our kiln is unloaded, our members can walk to the \"100 Bowl\" spot in the studio to admire the latest bowls that have been completed.</p>\n<p>There are short bowls and tall bowls, and wide bowls and flat bowls. Some with frilly rims and some with carving. All of them have been a labour of love. And we are looking forward to putting them in the hands of our amazing Backers. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Just a sample of the 100 bowls that EPG members have produced over the last 6 months. \" data-id=\"38995591\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/038/995/591/2d3b1238d7e9bbb530b60a343dd1345b_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1666459843&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2c3b5df053c9d90054022d86f022412f\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Just a sample of the 100 bowls that EPG members have produced over the last 6 months. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Many of you might be wondering \"when will I get my bowl?\".  The honest answer is that while we have made a ton of progress, there are still bowls in various stages of production, and we need a few weeks to finish them all off. </p>\n<p>For those Backers who will be picking up bowls, you will be hearing from us soon with a local pick-up date and time (we are aiming for a date sometime in late November).

The guild was a very busy place in June, as we started on our journey towards making 100 bowls. We've had a lot of fun so far, and we wanted to share some of the highlights with you from this past month. </p>\n<p>On June 3, we officially launched the project and hosted our very first 100 Bowl worker bee at the guild. Making a big bowl is challenging because it requires a lot of clay (usually between 6 and 8 pounds), and throwing this much clay is tricky, even for experienced potters. And so, the evening began with a throwing demonstration that was put on by two of our most experienced potters, and the demo was followed by everyone rolling up their sleeves to make a bowl (or two).  </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption='In our first worker bee, some of our most experienced potters shared their \"throwing big\" tips and tricks ' data-id=\"37804151\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/804/151/1a5c8dff3a67e373593ea59c482cab5e_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1656542465&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=3a8b7bcbc0af7479f82647cfc810ee3f\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">In our first worker bee, some of our most experienced potters shared their \"throwing big\" tips and tricks </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Our second worker bee occurred on June 16, and again we had several guild members put on demonstrations, but this time, the demos were focused on handbuilding and surface decoration techniques.  Handbuilding is a very different technique for making pottery than throwing on a wheel, and it involves shaping coils or a slab of clay into the desired form using a number of different methods. So, for this demo, we called on one of our most experienced handbuilders to walk us through a few of her techniques. In addition, several different surface decoration techniques were discussed, including sgraffito and carving. Both of these techniques include making impressions on the clay surface once the bowl has dried to a \"leather hard\" stage. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"In this demonstration of a handbuilding technique, our members learned how to use a box and an old sweater as a form to shape a slab of clay decorated with a leaf impression to make a big bow!\" data-id=\"37885956\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/037/885/956/ddcacadedc2f2d1847a9bdf4d89a0903_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1657207710&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=411d6859f6d8cc381b153bc7497525aa\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">In this demonstration of a handbuilding technique, our members learned how to use a box and an old sweater as a form to shape a slab of clay decorated with a leaf impression to make a big bow!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption='When a pot is \"leather hard\", surface decoration can be added using a number of different techniques.
