And thank you for your support :) we will be continuing with updates and potentially new add-ons. We are thinking a felt backed magnet could be nice. We have made something similar in the past. It would be quarter sized (or a little bigger)  piece of glazed speckled clay (same clay type as the ocean mug) with a strong magnet glued to the back of it. Then glued to the magnet is a thin piece of felt. They work well for refrigerators.

Thank you for backing and being an early bird :) We will look into the add-on feature. Admittedly, this is our first kick starter so we are still learning. We definitely need to limit the quantity of ocean mugs available on this kickstarter because it takes a super long time to create  them. With that said, if the add-on feature can allow us to still limit the number of total mugs available, then we are 100% on board with it.","createdAt":1617538858,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xMTg5OTUyNjAz","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/810/575/06241b02d37d13a7f283bf8fe33e4e22_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1617032958&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=d34699df721676c9b6044a93332a306f","name":"Jesse Cunningham V","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/jcunningham"}}]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0zMjE1OTg4Nw==","body":"Lots of love and support for someone who grew in Bmore!","createdAt":1617497820,"author":{"id":"VXNlci01NTcxMjU2Mjc=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/109/131/53d37bcb779d8f0eaba699caeaa7b950_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1589632483&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=961a0cbb909e0919edfe5a68ffd8f28e","name":"Theodore Koth","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/557125627"},"replies":{"totalCount":1,"nodes":[{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0zMjE1OTk2NA==","body":"Thank you!!!
