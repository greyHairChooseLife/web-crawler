If the trend continues as it has been, I imagine the EARLY BIRD mugs will sell out before the April 15th mark (that's our hope).</p>\n<p>After the EARLY BIRD mugs sell out, the add-on Ocean Mugs will still be available at a discounted price. <strong>This will last until April 15th.</strong> At that time, the add-on mugs (for those who want to purchase multiples) will revert back to the originally intended price of the Ocean Mug at $48. The shipping will still be reduced because you are purchasing multiples and we can usually bundle orders into one package. </p>\n<p>Bottom line w/ all of this: April 15th is still an important date. This is the last date you can order the add-on mugs at the discounted EARLY PRICE. So if you want multiples we encourage you to back sooner than later. </p>\n<br>\n<h1 id=\"h:in-closing\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>In closing</strong></h1>\n<p>Thank you all!

Awesome. <strong>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Some news: </strong>we've added the ability for pledgors to <strong>purchase an add-on mug or mugs (limit of 5).</strong> This will be at the EARLY BIRD pricing. Those who have purchased the EARLY BIRD pricing get the benefit of their first mug at that price as well as any additional mugs. </p>\n<p>The additional mugs (the add-on mug) will have a discounted shipping rate. It still costs additional money for us to ship multiples, but we are usually able to bundle them into one package which is cost-effective and we want to pass that savings onto you (we aren't trying to profit from shipping costs, at all). </p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>In other news: </strong>Isabel was at the wheel last night, throwing mugs. Now she is trimming them (getting any extra clay off the form in order to shape the piece) and putting handles on later. The clay is considered \"leather hard\" during this point in the process. And it feels just like leather, too. It's soft, yet firm and able to be handled gently.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Anyway, we are super excited to have all our your support! Thank you and talk soon!</p>\n<br>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Tiny Box Ceramics</p>\n<p>Isabel and Jesse</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1617470963,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"1000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"4725.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":58,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
