Today is the last day of our campaign and unfortunately, we could not hit our target of raising $40,000. Kickstarter operates on an all or nothing basis so it means this project will not be funded and you will not be billed on your credit card.</p>\n\n<p>During this uncertain economic times where most are concerned with bread and butter issues, I am very touched by each of your generousity and the moral support given to this project.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first and failed Kickstarter project but I’ve learnt a lot about how Kickstarter works and also about the ceramics industry. It is not the first time I encountered failed ventures and one thing I learnt is to absorb all these lessons quickly and come back stronger.</p>\n\n<p>I’m in the midst of planning other jobs (maybe Youtube cooking videos so you can follow us at @saybonssg for updates) that my older workers can do. Out of the 7 older workers I have, 4 have returned to work at my cafes as Singapore eased restrictions while the other 3 are still staying home.</p>\n\n<p>As for the 12 plates that I’ve painted, I now get to keep them as memories of Stay home quarantine times. (I’ve grown quite attached to all of them actually)\nHowever if you are still keen to purchase handpainted plates, you can reach out to me at daphane.loke@saybons.com</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, once again thank you for your support and keep safe.</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1591707562,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI4NTc3MDg=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"We reached 10% funded mark & added new rewards","publishedAt":1591707562,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Daphane Loke","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/007/250/18fd9fcf15a7731553a58fc00f985f33_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1588930242&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=6eb8bfe9f6f94c0a308690b6e55915b7","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1590909666,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"SGD","amount":"40000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"SGD","amount":"7619.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":45,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
