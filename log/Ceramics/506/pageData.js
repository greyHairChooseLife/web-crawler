I’ve always wanted to try so many different things, but I never had the opportunities to do so. Part of my younger years I spent out in Axson in Atkinson County. Even 18 years ago, there wasn’t much to do around this area. I wound up getting pregnant (with my now 16-year-old) during my Junior year in high school. I wound up living on my own, paying my bills, and finishing high school on my own. I was living on my own at 16 years old with an infant. \r\n\r\nAfter high school, I moved in with her father. He was a Marine at the time (also from Pearson) and was stationed at Parris Island in South Carolina. I had my son when I was 19 years old. A few years later my husband at the time was getting out of the Marines. He was getting medically discharged. I knew I had to do something to be able to provide for my children, so I joined the Army. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Their father wound up getting out and not getting a job. So he had to go. I spent seven years out of my 8-year enlistment as a single parent in the military.  A lot of my time in the military was spent away from my children.  I deployed to Iraq for 15 months and was the medic for an EOD (explosives ordnance disposal) security team.  My second deployment was to Afghanistan where I assisted in running a clinic for the area. \r\n\r\nI got out of the Army after meeting my current husband because it was time to go to college and be a mom again. I waited until my ETS date and got out of the Army as a Sergeant (E5) with full honors, two deployments under my belt, and a ton of valuable life skills. My husband and I decided it was time to get our degrees and move on in the civilian world. I started attending Western Carolina University in North Carolina that summer (we got out in March of 2014). I graduated in 3 ½ years with two Bachelor degrees in Marketing and Management. My youngest daughter decided to come into our lives in the middle of my college journey. I still attended classes while pregnant and maintained a 3.3 GPA. When she was born, I only missed three days of school. \r\n\r\nI’m telling you this because this shows my determination. I have beaten the odds over and over again throughout my life. I am motivated and determined to make things work.  \r\n\r\nCeramics came into my life during college. I started out taking a drawing class to learn more techniques and moved into ceramics. This changed my life. I took all four classes (four different skill level classes) in ceramics but continued my degrees in Marketing and Management. I felt like this would give me more tools that I could use in the future instead of pursuing an art degree. \r\n\r\nAfter I graduated college this past December, we ran into rough times. But we have been putting ourselves (my husband and I both) through college with three kids.  It hasn't been easy for us, but we have pulled through.  My husband graduates next month.  It's time to move onto the next chapter and my mission is to get this studio going and to help others who suffer like I have.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Jacqueline Worthington","creator_last_login":1526031875,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":2,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":2,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/worthingtonpottery/","domain":"facebook.com"},{"url":"https://www.etsy.com/shop/WorthingtonPottery","domain":"etsy.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/943/408/a54918fc09e70b880ae33624c333c7da_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1524844251&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1576948b05e36bf86609162f7580184b","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/583103367","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Worthington Pottery will help to bring art to a community that suffers from the lack of family-friendly activities and help local Veterans to learn ways to cope with the stressors of PTSD through art. The town of Waycross, Georgia lacks activities that families can do together. The bowling alley and skating rink have closed. There is nothing recreational to do in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>My business will provide family fun to the city of Waycross and surrounding areas. It will be a place where parents can bring their kids and enjoy activities together and help to build bonds. Or parents can come and put their child in the play area that will be located right beside the working area. Parents will be able to keep an eye on their child as they play. There are endless opportunities for this business.\n&nbsp;</p><p>I have located a building close to Harvey’s and Jerry J’s off Plant Avenue that fits perfectly with what I want to accomplish. It’s almost 3,000 square feet, and the layout works great for turning it into a pottery studio. The front building will be where the main studio is located along with the child play area, offices, display area, front desk, and customer bathroom. The back building has two levels. The bottom level will be used as a private studio, storage, and glazing area. The glazing area needs to be kept separate from the clay area for firing purposes. This area could also be used in the future for a paint-your-own pottery area. The top area of the second building will be the employee area only. This will allow us to be able to keep our food separate from the areas downstairs and comply with safety standards of the studio. \n&nbsp;</p><p>I am putting in an offer for $45,000 for the buildings and property. It’s listed at $54,000, but a lot of updates and renovations need to be done. To bring the building up to code, a lot of rotten boards and sections need to be replaced; it will need a new roof, and various other things like installing exit signs, replacing the stairs, and updating the breakers and meters.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a lot of work that needs to be done to the property, but I’m not afraid of a little work. Everything will be done to code and by licensed professionals. All renovations will cost between $40,000-$45,000. This will include tearing down walls to open the place up, new flooring, and interior and exterior painting. A lot of the painting and such I will do myself along with family members. I have a lot of experience with drywall, basic carpentry skills, and painting. All plumbing and electric will be done by licensed professionals also. \n&nbsp;</p><p>Another aspect of my business will be my work and working with Veterans with PTSD. I have started a movement called “throwing for PTSD,” (#throwingforptsd). The act of “throwing” in the ceramic world is what we do when we spin clay on the wheel. I have been through a lot in my life since I was a child. Then I joined the military, and I’ve deployed twice to Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent events in my life have opened my eyes to this disease, and this cause brings attention to it. It shouldn’t be taboo to talk about mental illnesses. It should be talked about more often so more people will seek help. There is a VA hospital located in Waycross, and I will continue this movement with Veterans from the area. \n&nbsp;</p><p>Art is also an excellent source of therapy for Veterans with PTSD. I want to be able to offer art therapy sessions. These will be private sessions that I will conduct and show Veterans various ways they can cope with their anxiety and other PTSD issues through art. I have had three anxiety attacks that have sent me to the hospital since I have been out of the Army. The last one was because my studio was vandalized at home, but this anxiety attack was one I wasn’t able to calm myself down from. This was the first time I had to have an injection in the ER to calm down. This is a serious disease, but it doesn’t have to be.\n You can see more about my journey on my business Facebook page. \n&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/worthingtonpottery/\n</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have overcome so many things in my life.
