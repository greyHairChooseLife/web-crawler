I decided to experiment with different spoons but none of them were working well. Most of the serving spoons are made of cheap plastics and are prone to break easily. Not to mention, they just don’t look as good.\nI have been working on this project for almost a year now.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Made from olive branch\" data-caption=\"Made from olive branch\" data-id=\"5656690\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Made from olive branch\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/656/690/cdeebb5e9243e9be8a01c8bb68a35e35_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459868368&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=79e0053f8af08cd81b4becc00ad08eaf\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Made from olive branch</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>I come from a tribe that&nbsp; is known for producing quality crafts and wood products. Last November, i visited Kenya my country of birth and I spent some time with some of the craftsmen. I wanted to learn as much as i could before launching my product.&nbsp; I have designed a serving spoon set that will put a smile on every one who appreciates cooking.\nThe salad serving spoon is a set of wooden serving spoon with a great design and a nice finish that can be used together or separately.</p><p>To make sure that I had the right concept, I also&nbsp; paid a visit to the people who are famous for making amazing furniture out of wood.  The Amish.\nThis experience gave me a lot of knowledge and wisdom. \nI then returned to my workshop and got my juices flowing. And boy was I on fire.</p><p>I gave out a few of these serving spoons to several people and asked them for their honest feedback. I have gotten some of the best feedback. This has boosted my confidence and now I feel that I’m ready to make my product available to the world.\nI feel that now I have the salad spoon that every chef has been waiting for. </p><p>What makes this spoon unique?\nThe Spoon is carved from the Olive tree which gives it a clean natural luster. \nThe Olive tree is known to be resilient and hard to break. Therefore these spoons have the potential to serve families for generations to come.  This spoon can be dropped kicked without breaking. </p><p>In Ancient civilization, the Olive branch was a symbol of peace. Ancient traditions and in the Scriptures, Olive oil was used to anoint Kings and Priests into positions of authority. They used olive oil because its very essence represented all that is celestial, all that is good and all that is full of love and charity.</p><p>In Ancient Greek, the Olive tree represented Health, wealth, wisdom, hope, light, fertility, and balance.\nI feel that by bringing this salad serving spoon to the kitchens and dining tables of all around the world, I am continuing to represent and spread all that is good and blessed. </p><p>Finally I use soapstone from California to give the handle a nice finish. The soapstone is a natural It is product of  dynamothermal metamorphism and metasomatism, which occurs in the zones where tectonic plates are subducted, changing rocks by heat and pressure, with influx of fluids, but without melting.\n It has been a medium for carving for thousands of years. It gives the spoon a very nice finish and compliments the nice clean luster of the olive wood.\nI’m am ready to get to production. I believe in this product. This is&nbsp; a great solution to many families and restaurants.

My experience is That  creativity beats competition every time.\r\nI have tested this product with many different people and have gotten very good feedback. \r\nThe other  challenge I could run into is having too many orders than I am able to fulfill at he moment;\r\nI think this is actually a good problem to have because it means there’s a great demand and we have a good product which we do..\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n I can overcome this problem by increasing my production and recruiting new talent.\r\nI also need to acquire better equipment that can help make the production go faster.\r\n\r\nChallenge:  \r\nWhat about the trees?\r\nOne of the concerns and question i want to address is \"are we destroying the trees?\" \r\n\r\nThe answer to that is NO. We don't cut any trees down Ever, We just trim the overgrown branches which actually helps the tree in the renewal process.. The olive tree can last for many generations. some olive trees have been estimated to be 1500 years old. we are not about to destroy that tradition. we are committed to preserving the trees.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 20</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>For your generous gift of or more, I will send you a hand written thank you letter.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-06-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Jun 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>For your generous gift, .
