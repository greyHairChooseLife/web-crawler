And for the amount of money the repairs would cost we were two thirds of the way to a new kiln anyway. So it just makes sense to purchase the new kiln now, and repair the bigger old one over time.</b></p><p><b>Now I know what you are thinking, \"Great. How long is this going to take?\" But don't worry. The timeline to buy a new kiln is actually the same as it was to repair the old one. The new kiln is ordered and in-progress. And in the next several weeks, I can focus on getting everything finished and glazes mixed up, rather than having to track down elements and coordinate with Skutt for parts. Plus, this means that we know it will work when it gets here. There's no waiting and hoping. Lol. And since the new kiln will be in my apartment, I will be able to fire it more often than if it were off-site. And even better, I wont have to lose the time it takes to fire being off-site, so I can be more efficient with my time.</b></p><p><b>I know everyone is anxious to get their rewards, and I am anxious to send them out.

I'm really sorry that I can't stick to the original delivery dates everybody. The original timeline was do-able, but really tight. I just did not have a 3-4 week buffer in there to deal with such extensive kiln issues. Thanks for being so patient with me.
