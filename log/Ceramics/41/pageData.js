Each of our pottery pieces is considered a landscape, with calming glaze colors and hand detailed imagery. Our pieces are designed to provide moments of calm, and reminders of the vast natural environments that surround the fast-paced metropoles that many of us inhabit.&nbsp;</p><p>For this limited edition line, we're offering the Caribou and 100 Hand-Painted Stars illustration on our large mug.&nbsp;</p><p>We chose the Caribou for this project because they exhibit an incredible amount of endurance as they migrate over 1,600 miles each year. Caribou live in herds and traverse&nbsp;some of the harshest environments on the planet. In this time of political transition and conflict, we at SKT believe that our strength lies in our connectivity. By moving forward together, we can protect our environment and its inhabitants.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15014875\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/014/875/2881df0c1e4c270bc5cee32ed796f9c6_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1483046995&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=0c5b37ca8fd9ddedcadf5e7f5d120675\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Each mug features 100 stars, hand-painted over the entire landscape of the mug with the same wax that we use to define our raw porcelain \"ground\" on our pieces.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Front and back of our Caribou Mug with 100 hand painted stars\" data-caption=\"Front and back of our Caribou Mug with 100 hand painted stars\" data-id=\"15059683\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Front and back of our Caribou Mug with 100 hand painted stars\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/059/683/b75231162156651adddc99855c7bb66f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1483536055&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=dc2e090a6799ff66425382b55437e506\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Front and back of our Caribou Mug with 100 hand painted stars</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>In the spirit of the 1,000 cranes or 1,000 stitches on Japanese Senninbari, as we hand paint each individual star at&nbsp;SKT, we address each piece with the intention of crafting a more welcoming global community.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senninbari\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Japanese Hand Stitched Senninbari\" data-caption=\"Japanese Hand Stitched Senninbari\" data-id=\"15041539\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Japanese Hand Stitched Senninbari\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/041/539/304be9434fa6786f2b2a1d6e67adc35e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1483386978&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=695f13b4e4c56289a28c171f27f3a626\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Japanese Hand Stitched Senninbari</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</a><p>With 100 mugs available, the group of mugs, each individually detailed with 100 stars, forms 10,000 stars.

Korean Celadon was refined during the Goryeo dynasty (918â€“1392) and celadon was established as the main type of ceramics produced on the Korean peninsula. Similar to their approach thousands of years ago, we&nbsp;rely on the dynamic atmosphere in the kiln to develop our complex and luminous glaze results.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15059728\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/059/728/e7269ac06ee79a30e05ddce12f6ce055_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1483536309&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2bbc56a031a4077bdd627787ea27519b\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The use of Korean Celadon appropriately commemorates this time for SKT at Queen City Clay- a pottery school and ceramic supply retailer in Cincinnati, Ohio. Their studio welcomed SKT Ceramics and the RAM press to the studio for a 2 year period while we renovate our future studio and retail space in Cincinnati. We're grateful for the community and the ability to continue to produce our gas kiln fired work.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">All of the SKT Ceramics pieces are hand crafted in our Cincinnati studio before being fired in a gas kiln. The gas kiln provides the dynamic firing atmosphere and we occasionally have to make and remake pieces until we are happy with the results. This occasionally causes delays, but the SKT team regularly processes hundreds of pieces a week to meet the needs of our retailers and web customers so we see no reason why we wouldn't be able to meet the delivery date. We will communicate any delays as they happen.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMTU1MzcyMTA4","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":4,"number_of_comments_depth_all":8,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nOur limited-edition mug with our Caribou illustration surrounded by 100 hand painted stars in an indigo glaze sky\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/041/814/6f8146af980ad4146b9387f3576d4d32_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1483389145&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=dd33bb0d55fb463c58ef00191b80a4c2","last_updated":"April 23, 2017","project_name":"ake100: SKT Ceramics Caribou Mu","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"4,500","amount_of_pledged":"7,177","number_of_backers":"110","rate_of_funded":159,"project_we_love":true,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Cincinnati, OH","creator_name":"Susannah Tisue","creator_location":"Cincinnati, OH","creator_description":"Cincinnati based artist Susannah Tisue has a degree in fine art from New York University and developed her pottery knowledge as a resident artist and faculty member at the historic Greenwich House Pottery in Manhattan.
