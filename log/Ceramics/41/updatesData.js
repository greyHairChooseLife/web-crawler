Since we presented this project with the idea of the mugs forming a single unit, the idea of shipping any of the mugs earlier than the full group doesn't seem appropriate. We have new large mugs in production and should be able to send out all 100 mugs, together, on or before May 10. I'm going to share all of the photos of the mugs in production with you in the photos below. It has been such a fun and fulfilling project for our team to work on for the past few months. </p><p>We've been posting images of the project on Instagram and Facebook (@sktceramics) with the hashtag #caribouand100stars. The production of the mugs is only the first part of the story- I look forward to each of you sharing how the mug fits into your lives and inspires you to move forward with positive intention! </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"First peek at the Caribou and 100 Stars Mug\" data-caption=\"First peek at the Caribou and 100 Stars Mug\" data-id=\"16359734\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"First peek at the Caribou and 100 Stars Mug\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/359/734/8cf05e1a22e19adc32af69f601474983_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1492903096&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8e3a87ea57d71268bfe812a41b57296e\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">First peek at the Caribou and 100 Stars Mug</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Our sample mug from the video has become a studio favorite- helping us along with handles.\" data-caption=\"Our sample mug from the video has become a studio favorite- helping us along with handles.\" data-id=\"16359745\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Our sample mug from the video has become a studio favorite- helping us along with handles.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/359/745/302205ebea20a8ebdd2790d8414a8eeb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1492903159&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6d66be82cc0bad86699bc3825fc78927\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Our sample mug from the video has become a studio favorite- helping us along with handles.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Britney refining the handle joint.\" data-caption=\"Britney refining the handle joint.\" data-id=\"16359774\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Britney refining the handle joint.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/359/774/14c5222bad97870079bf1fc3a4024ff3_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1492903374&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c2b25cba0e1d39e8a5e14bd498537ad3\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Britney refining the handle joint.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"100 mugs, bone-dry and ready to transfer.\" data-caption=\"100 mugs, bone-dry and ready to transfer.\" data-id=\"16359825\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"100 mugs, bone-dry and ready to transfer.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/359/825/21d0bfea73e65276ef042b33888f630c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1492903726&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a4ade369afbbc293c3552803609beac3\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">100 mugs, bone-dry and ready to transfer.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Freshly screen printed Caribou and 100 Stars underglaze prints.\" data-caption=\"Freshly screen printed Caribou and 100 Stars underglaze prints.\" data-id=\"16359831\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Freshly screen printed Caribou and 100 Stars underglaze prints.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/359/831/0cc101684545b8053bc72aa129ff9435_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1492903772&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=3611b44af82bd4601a8808c1d5982c53\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Freshly screen printed Caribou and 100 Stars underglaze prints.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"16359834\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/359/834/9283e467a2d47ae92dd9183611cb9314_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1492903830&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1c560fac5c952467d89c3d539f00ae7c\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The Caribou and 100 Stars mug is our first wraparound image.

We were blown away by the attendance and positive energy of the event. We marched to support our schools, to preserve our national parks, and to radiate love in the face of hate. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Women's March in Downtown Cincinnati\" data-caption=\"Women's March in Downtown Cincinnati\" data-id=\"15269991\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Women's March in Downtown Cincinnati\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/269/991/1fc20ea159ddc4db73d06d1220936966_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1485265287&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c2bbe0a3b2733a8d59571035d9af50ea\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Women's March in Downtown Cincinnati</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Back at home that evening, I poured over the news and social media, energized by the individuals in small US towns and remote corners of the earth who left their homes and comfort zones to protect each other. I was amazed the numbers of people that filled streets in huge cities. It was amazing to watch it all unfold. </p><p>When my husband pulled up on Sunday evening, he hadn't seen a bit of news in 3 days. I couldn't hold back the details of the weekend and the global call to action. </p><p>In the days following the march, things ebb and flow- we live in the same divided nation that we did before the election. Things have just forced their way to the surface, like the creek that overflows, creating a deafening roar. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15270233\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/270/233/808ae93185d869a63766f15281e39a0b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1485266923&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=be41711dc38413e5d03406779cb41465\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p><p>In hiking terms, we are at the trailhead.

It was designed to unite. As we at SKT meticulously detail each mug, we do so with the pledge to put energy into our local community as well. We hope the Caribou mug gives each of you strength, and empowers your small acts knowing that there are hundreds and thousands of people out there acting and moving forward with purpose and forming real life connections. </p><p>Susannah, SKT Ceramics</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1483712341,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE3NzgzMDU=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Thank you!!!!","publishedAt":1483712341,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Susannah Tisue","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/859/842/c36345ce521d31f776528f2f6b664205_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1483534043&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=84b6bd2e7aa09faa609e27d8a2cf6040","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":9,"commentsCount":1,"body":"<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"15081275\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/081/275/482d6036a3ead46346b568e088cc69b4_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1483710010&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=310f1a68378573c76b857eb9076ca089\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>We are so thankful for the rallying of support around the Caribou and 100 Stars mug and we cannot wait to start working on them! It has been awe-inspiring to see pledges coming in from across the country and across the globe. Bridging connections between individuals and communities was the goal of the project and we cannot wait until these mugs are in use in your homes.</p><p>What happens next? </p><p>Our kickstarter project is \"live\" until February 3 at 9 am. We won't be adding any additional rewards - we set out in the beginning to make 100 mugs and that is our focus. The fact that our project was funded within the first 48 hours is humbling and so amazing. </p><p>With the early funding, we'll be able to start working on the mugs *today* so that we can get them in your hands as soon as possible. We'll be posting frequent updates with photos of the production of the mugs here and on social media- @sktceramics on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sktceramics/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sktceramics/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>. </p><p>Kickstarter will process the mug payment on February 3- please make sure the card that you have submitted on your account is the one you'd like to use on that date! </p><p>For those of you who submitted a no-reward contribution, thank you!! We will put the funds towards the materials that we use to make the mugs- your presence and enthusiasm for the idea will be contained within the 100 mugs as well. </p><p>Feel free to contact us at any time with any questions, we look forward to sharing the process with you this month and cannot wait to send out your mug. </p><p>Susannah and the SKT Team- Michael, Theo, Britney, Christina, Gaby, Mauri and Mindy</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1483539438,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"4500.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"7177.02","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":110,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
