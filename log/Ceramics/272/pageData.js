Currently, we feature paint-your-own pottery, canvas painting, clay workshops including hand-building and wheel-throwing. We would like to shift the focus of the studio from a simple store into a meaningful place for artists (and those interested in art) to connect and work together. We want to transform the studio into a place where we can have more artist working space, a space to host classes for adults, children, including those with special needs. &nbsp;We will host events that foster a sense of community such as poetry nights, live music, &nbsp;gallery openings, and educational events. The current &nbsp;business is in need of physical improvements, equipment, and items that we need to build a better art studio!</p>\n\n<p>The building we are in is an historic early-20th century house that is in need of repairs and investments that will add to the energy efficiency and cleanliness of the space.</p><p>We intend to spend the money on&nbsp;</p><ul>\n<li>Tiling the front half of the studio which is now particle board that cannot be mopped and results in lots of excess clay dust. ($500)</li>\n<li>Aprons for the painting and clay students. ($100 - 8@$12.50/ea)</li>\n<li>Adding a brick-and-stone patio and a pit for pit-firing to the backyard for events. ($1500)</li>\n<li>Durable furniture for the studio to replace the army of folding chairs and tables we currently use. ($1500)</li>\n<li>Clay equipment including: a larger slab roller($$895.00), two additional pottery wheels($/500ea), an extruder($if funding allows), and two glaze mixers($/50ea).</li>\n<li>Increased inventory for clay and glazes that we carry.</li>\n<li>and most importantly advertising&nbsp;to let&nbsp;our local community know about us and our events!

A likely solution is to help promote the space we have and the place it will soon become! We believe the improvements that come with upgrading the equipment and increasing advertisements while help overcome this obstacle.  \r\n\r\nAnother challenge will be finding good used equipment to make your dollars count. Our extensive research, years of experience in retail and art, and practical knowledge of products will help us get the best value equipment we can for your money. \r\n\r\nA final consideration is the labor involved in the larger projects such as tiling the floor and installing a brick/stone patio in the backyard. We will count on our own labor along with our friends, family, and volunteers from high school and university work study programs.\r\n\r\nIf we encounter setbacks or unforeseen costs, we will focus on projects like tiling the entrance, acquiring new equipment, and advertisements. By prioritizing our goals we will ensure that the most useful ones are accomplished first, thereby furthering our ability to achieve our more distant goals. However, if our Kickstarter is funded, we are confident that we can successfully achieve the goals that we have set forth in this plan.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":8,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>We will send you an air high five and a personalized handmade art postcard.
