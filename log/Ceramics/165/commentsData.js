The contents inside were safe and sound! I was honestly amazed at the craftsmanship of both the mug and pour over and they matched so well, as if they were made for each other. Very well made ... love it, love it!!  \n\nBut ... I also need to be honest in saying that with 3 attempts of using the pour over, I've not yet gotten a successful cup of coffee. The v60 filter sags at the bottom and the coffee pools rather than freely dripping and when I lift the filter to allow the coffee to drip into the (beautiful) cup, it ends up splitting open at the bottom. I'm afraid the wall of the pour over is to rounded and not at a sharper angle. \n\nBy no means am I upset, I backed this project because of your ceramics and wanting to support your abilities not based on your barista skills and abilities!!","createdAt":1557864050,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xMDQyNDI4NzY4","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/170/619/f369381048a44e9452c58ecf63e22a01_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1461371146&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=709db92927ef4b3a37c8dbca3b0c21fb","name":"Scott Huck","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1042428768"},"replies":{"totalCount":2,"nodes":[{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0yNDE4Nzk0Mg==","body":"UPDATE ....

I did not know that they make perfectly coned filters for certain pour overs, but the ones I use are just from the grocery store and have a flat bottom to them. I would have mentioned \"don't get the pointy ones!\" if I knew those existed! But I am glad you figured that out because other people may have that problem. So thank you for sharing! And also thank you so much again for your support and nice comments on my work. With everyone's help I am able to purchase a small kiln for my home! That is amazing!
