Received my Gill Man mug today. Looks great with one exception 2 spots on the skull he is holding are white. Does not feel like a chip itâ€™s smooth just no color. Happy to keep the one I got but wanted to ask if there any others to purchase that have the complete glaze?  Thanks. Pics available for QC reasons if you want them. Nice job.","createdAt":1603642028,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xOTkzMTE0NTQ5","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=38b545eeac1249d5d25c87db69d5ee12","name":"tom saville","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1993114549"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}}]
