But it does in ways that you cannot imagine. The young woman pictured here was enamored with the purple tones of the mug, and purchased it right away. She was laughing as she poured the rest of her soda in it as she was walking away, and I heard from her later, it is still one of her favorite mugs to drink from. </p><p>The other is one that I was so honored to do. As sometimes happens, things go wrong that you don't expect. A flat tire that you cannot get fixed, and boom, here comes two sheriff's officers that came to the rescue. They got the car moved, the tire changed, and didn't ask for a thing, just said they were glad to help. When I told them I wanted to make them some mugs, the only thing they asked for was this symbol on it. </p><p>Both officers had it on, in a memory of one of their friends and fellow officer that died in the line of duty. I was glad, and extremely humbled to be able to do this for them. It made me feel like I had helped in a way to give them a smile that they could remember him. They both have the mugs at work on their desks, and use them constantly. Which is something that makes me so very proud. </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1465342564,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE1OTc5NTY=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"More Pottery.","publishedAt":1465342564,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Andrea Feagain","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/520/975/f28b9dd763494baf5896bedd69d99ffb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1464198862&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=5a01a9cee003f6d9aa78b43fa671a5af","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>I want you all to see what I have been doing.
