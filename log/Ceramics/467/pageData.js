I had found a place to belong, and one that I did not want to leave. But my body had other idea's and it could not keep up with the constant pounding and daily regimen that it took to keep up in the battle field. So I had to let go of that dream.&nbsp;</p><p>The adage that when one door closes, another one opens is, for me at least, a kind of reality. I came home at the age of 39, to live with my disabled mom, my dad, and my then fourteen year old daughter in my home state of Ohio. We all ended up piled up in a small house together, and I started using my GI Bill to go to school. I was taking Graphic Design when I looked at the list of classes I needed to take to get my BFA, I said what the hell, lets see what pottery is about. I never minded getting dirty, too much of a tomboy for that.&nbsp;</p><p>It took my nearly another three semesters of work to realize that I was not meant for Graphic Design. I can do the work, but I had found my love when I touched the clay. At the time, I was seeing a wonderful man named Joel, and he convinced me that it was worth the risk to try it, to be happy in doing what I love. That was throwing on the wheel.&nbsp;</p><p>I have never been a restful person, there is almost always something going on in my head. My poor mother said, &nbsp;\"Andi I always knew you went to the beat of your own drummer. I just didn't know it was a drum corp with turrets!\" That's my mother for you, but she and the rest of the family backed me without hesitation.&nbsp;</p><p>I made my appointment and changed my major, talked my professor into letting me take the class as an Advanced Ceramics student with the help of my friend Samantha, and away I went. No one was sure of me like I was sure of myself when I started this. Every time there was a critique, I listened, took notes, watched video's on youtube from so many different artists it was insane. I immersed myself in the world of pottery in a way that I think only those that find it touches them so deeply do.</p><p>When I throw, I say I am watching something grow, because that is what it feels like to me. I am watching the clay transform from this lump of nothing, to something that someone can hold in their hand and notice the small details, the weight, the way the handle rests on your fingers, just how your drink stays warm so long. There are a hundred different things abut the beauty of it that touch me.</p><p>There is no room for doubt, there is nothing but the will and drive to make these objects, some of my own design, others as replica's of things from the past all around the world. There is no just one thing I do</p><p>The amount of work that goes into these is staggering if you do not understand it. What comes from a lump in the ground has to be handled, processed, then put on the wheel, turned and made into the object. Left to sit to slow dry so that the clay does not crack and break from the stress of it. Put into the first firing, which goes to about 1800-1900 degrees F, left to cool for on average 2 days for the kiln to come back down from that heat. Taken from the kiln, glazed, then put back into the kiln to be fired at about 2230 degrees F.</p><p>Just the time alone that I do this is worth it to me, but to make this work, I have to think about how long it takes me to process each piece. Once you know, you come to truly appreciate the time taken for true hand made work, and that is the people that I want to touch, to contact, that know that the price they have paid for the object in their hand, or on their mantle is well worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I am working on changing over the garage into a fully functional studio. That is what this is all about. Installing a kiln, the wiring, the workings that all go to make a studio work and produce the best functional pottery I can put out. The problem is, that its not cheap. The best estimate I got for an electrician to run the line is $250-600 depending on what is needed. The kiln itself is $2600 at Ohio Ceramic Supply, furniture package is another $419, the enviorvent on the kiln, which vents any gases outside and makes for a better firing is another $640, the rolling stand for the kiln is $406.&nbsp;</p><p>This goes beyond that, this also will cover the $450 I need to build my own mobile display stands. The nearly $1500 for the fire retardant Renaissance&nbsp;Faire style tent I need, and another $2000 for a small trailer and licensing for it. All of these together make it hard to do this piecemeal, and I am trying. I buy all my clay, and that is just about $56 per 50 lb box. So coming here was the chance I have to do it all at one time, and truly bring it all together.&nbsp;</p><p>This is my project, and my dream, making historical and contemporary pottery at home full time. It is something that will carry me forward into a full time working potter, and able to display my art, and share my art with the world around me.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The risks I have at the moment are honestly not having a kiln. I have to go to Ohio Ceramics, and pay $75.00 every time I need to fire, and I have to take these fragile pieces and put them in boxes, put them in the car and take them to the shop to be fired. So far I loose about 1/8th of my work because of the state of the roads, no matter how careful I drive, when it is in the greenware state.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":4,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>You will get one large hand thrown ceramic mug in one of four different colors.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n3 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>You will receive a matching pair of hand thrown ceramic mugs in the color of your choice.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (24 left of 25)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 150</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 150</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Two matching mugs, and two bowls to go with them of your choice in color.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 500</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 500</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>You will receive a complete dinner set of four plates, four bowls, and four large mugs in the color of your choice.
