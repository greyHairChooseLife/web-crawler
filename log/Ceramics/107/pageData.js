You might know me from my previous Kickstarter campaign, the book <span class=\"bold\">Mr. McFrawley's Traveling Show</span>, from the cartoons I animated for PLANTS VS. ZOMBIES VS. JAY AND SILENT BOB, or from my #tikiaday sketch project on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have been a tikiphile for about 20 years, staring with Disney and Michener, and eventually voyaging into the deep corners of Polynesian Pop. All of this reading and sketching eventually led me back around again to the original source material, and I've since built a library of 50 books on Polynesia, tiki culture, art, and history.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I believe in Hawaiian independence and I believe in Trader Sam's.&nbsp;It's a mixed bag.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I've been trying to reconcile all of these disparate ideas and influences into a big, wild, colorful and crazy picture book, which I could sell with a series of mugs. But with a &nbsp;growing family (two amazing kids under 3), the mugs have come quickly, and the book has come slowly. Consider this release my first foray into a much larger project.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"29406700\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/406/700/fd7c8a6c91957cd9b53dd20213b46323_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1591741325&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=21f74ccc70ade0c08b6e1384656727a5\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This project is HAPPENING.
