I’m the owner/artist at Mountainside Pottery, LLC in Catawissa, Pennsylvania.\n\nI’d like to tell you a little bit about how Mountainside Pottery came about, where we’re headed, and how you can help!&nbsp;</p><p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been involved in art one way or another. Do you remember those “Can you draw” characters that used to be in magazines? I remember sketching samples and sending them in… then the letter that came telling me that I could draw and I should sign up for lessons!&nbsp;I know they probably told all the kids that, just to get them to buy art lessons, but it encouraged me to keep sketching.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Learning how to draw a horse\" data-caption=\"Learning how to draw a horse\" data-id=\"13609164\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Learning how to draw a horse\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/609/164/5117709733714d4a6f57333478921c83_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473097897&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=747721bbfca47b9edefc72662bb84b9f\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Learning how to draw a horse</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Black Stallion\" data-caption=\"Black Stallion\" data-id=\"13609251\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Black Stallion\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/609/251/282e8e1530d901c82a7937459649c373_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473098374&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f14dc5b02fbb77c3ec860c48dcf6b7cc\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Black Stallion</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>That encouragement, sparked my interest in art, and has led me down many paths over the years. From painting ceramics to painting murals, turning tree knots into home decor, wood burning, wreaths, and one of my favorite... floral design! I made every bouquet my daughter ever carried to all her dances and proms... but the most important one... her wedding bouquet!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"13610424\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/610/424/8d443f82011b3bc1060edc5899ecba0a_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473105554&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8589c08bff2941699242ad6559765071\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Although I truly enjoyed them all, it wasn't until I started to dabble in pottery, that my true artistic passion evolved! I realized, that all the other mediums I had explored, were not just for fun... they were the building blocks I needed for a well-rounded understanding of the purpose of my artistic gift!</p><p>Up until a few years ago, art was just a hobby and I was working for a Fortune 50 company in a management position. I had some health issues, that put me out on medical leave for a couple months, and during that leave, life took a CRAZY spin!&nbsp;</p><p>You see, Allen and I had been empty-nesters for about 5 years, and then all of a sudden, in one day… we were raising five of our grandchildren.\n\nThe oldest was 8, and the other 4… well, they were 2 ½ year old quadruplets! You want to talk about life changing experiences!!!&nbsp;</p><p>For the first couple months, I cried myself to sleep every night, or cried my eyes out in the shower so no one noticed. \n\nI had NO IDEA how we were going to do this. Every night I said, “God, I just don’t think I can do this anymore”… then every morning I said, “Ok, it’s a brand new day… let’s do it again!”&nbsp;</p><p>How did we do it? Not alone, that’s for sure! If it wasn’t for our faith in God, our amazing family and friends, and our local churches… well… who knows what would have happened.\n\nI left the management position to stay home with the kids (since daycare for four 2 ½ year old’s was about $650/week), and clay became an important part of my day... I called it my therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>We even converted the dining room into a \"studio\" so I could be with the kids, and work with clay at the same time. They loved pulling their chairs up to the front of my work area and watching, trying, and creating! If it was a bad weather day, and we couldn't be outside, clay became a method of \"dealing\" with obstacles for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Their creative minds went to work overtime, and they fell in love with art of all kinds. So much so, that when they went to Head Start, all the teachers joked... \"We can tell their Nana is an artist, as soon they have free play, they head right to the art station\"! Honestly, I think that's where my love for teaching art to kids developed.</p><p>Ok... so let's fast forward to 2 years later... The quadruplets are back living with their mom, however; we still maintain joint custody. It's still a bit of a rocky road, but life has settled down a bit.</p><p>I knew it wasn't time for me to go back to a full-time job, the possibility of the kids coming back was too high, so I started a website, Facebook Page, Etsy and Artsy Home store to sell my pottery, hoping to contribute to the household expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Wine/Design Group - Pitchers Accomplished!\" data-caption=\"Wine/Design Group - Pitchers Accomplished!\" data-id=\"13617824\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Wine/Design Group - Pitchers Accomplished!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/617/824/801ebb09bc63629ce1ef9a319c7b4b88_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473164996&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1a37d4eac5f98d80a19a2ef7ce539d50\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Wine/Design Group - Pitchers Accomplished!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"After they were fired and glazed!\" data-caption=\"After they were fired and glazed!\" data-id=\"13617812\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"After they were fired and glazed!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/617/812/2d2d52f8cf650f47c1ded26152895801_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473164855&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a8aaf2b74e2ac7ab93e9184213ee7944\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">After they were fired and glazed!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Then one day, my husband and I were at a local hardware store, and ran into a friend from years back. \n\nWe got to chatting about life, and what we’ve been doing, our family, where we were living, my pottery, etc... then she asked, \"The pottery thing, do you give lessons?\"&nbsp;</p><p>Before I could answer, my husband said, “Yes she does!” Quite honestly, I wanted to deck him, then run out of the store crying! No I don’t give lessons, I’m teaching myself, I’ve only been doing it 2 years as a hobby, I’m not good enough… all this stuff was racing around in my head!&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, with his support and encouragement, and even with all that doubt, I started offering workshops. The plan was to use our garage to host them, however; it was so cold and snowy, we had to do the first 2 in the house. We moved all the furniture out of the living room, set up a couple tables, and had a blast! &nbsp;And that’s where Mountainside Pottery was born!&nbsp;</p><p>In March of 2015, we made the decision to convert our garage into a studio since we couldn’t afford to build one. \n\nWe bought a whole pile of neglected rough cut lumber for $400, purchased enough left over insulation on Craigslist to do the entire building, bartered services, traded pottery pieces for supplies, and even tore down part of the horses run-in-shed for the metal. \n\nIn three weeks time, my husband, his brother and I, turned our garage into a fully functional studio.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"13608808\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/608/808/d9346aed38d06a05f176d37928792ccc_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473095828&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ee45df77669ffd1b944bed27ca776f3c\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Renovations Complete!\" data-caption=\"Renovations Complete!\" data-id=\"13608666\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Renovations Complete!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/608/666/a9fffadc0458e1a1b3ef89ca97c5af7e_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473095001&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1c2290db0d307e06a986ee1a2640f209\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Renovations Complete!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Workshops and lessons started out slowly, but in April of this year (2016), one of the Home School groups in our area reached out to me for the families in their group... from there... well, things went NUTS!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Parents/Kids Working Together\" data-caption=\"Parents/Kids Working Together\" data-id=\"13608682\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Parents/Kids Working Together\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/608/682/ba1c95d2f46b15091eaecfc1a438bcce_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473095092&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ed0098d2c05e841e50d3f411f4bd439c\" data-airgap-id=\"33\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Parents/Kids Working Together</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>That group has been back four times, they reached out to other groups that started coming, and some of the area pre-schools, Girl Scouts and 4H clubs jumped on board as well.</p><p>In May, I hosted 7 workshops, and in June... 6 more!

We've bartered items and services, worked with neighboring businesses, exchanged labor for hay to feed the animals, and helped renovate buildings in exchange for supplies to remodel our garage, and have no intentions of slacking off now.\r\n    At this point, Mountainside Pottery is self-sufficient, however; with kiln repairs and electricity eating up the profits, the business does not have the ability to pay me a salary. \r\n    If the project is fully funded, risk of failure is minimal. With a larger and energy efficient kiln, handicap accessible additions, and a restroom, we have the potential for offering art experiences to a much larger audience. \r\n    This also means, we would be able to increase the amount of profitable workshops and classes, which in turn, would increase the profit and help grow Mountainside Pottery.\r\n    The only potential risks we forsee would be those beyond our control. For instance, injury/illness or a natural disaster. For those situations, business, health and disability insurances would come into the equation.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\"
