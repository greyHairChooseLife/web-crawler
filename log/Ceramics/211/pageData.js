Our kilns ran great, until they didn't. &nbsp;My kiln needs new elements, and Adam's kiln needs new switches. &nbsp;Since we opened, our kilns have been running non-stop--which is <i>GREAT.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Nothing makes us happier than a successful firing. Seeing our students' faces light up with that same magic that got us hooked on making pottery in the beginning is the best feeling in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Running our studio is going to be infinitely easier with a larger kiln that has a computer controller on it. &nbsp;Both of our kilns have manual sitters on them, which means we have to turn them up every hour and watch them through completion. &nbsp;Many late nights in the studio (especially with non-working elements) will be a thing of the past with a brand new kiln! Instead of loading up one kiln after another, a larger capacity will help us be a little more \"green\" with our energy usage. &nbsp;With a larger kiln we are hoping to only fire once every week or two, rather than 3-4 times a week.</p><p>A new computer controller will also be a learning tool for our students. &nbsp;The technology that kiln manufacturers have developed over the years has come a long way. &nbsp;Providing us with a digital overview of our firing and completely customized firing schedules, as well as how much power is going to each of the elements takes a lot of the guess work out of kiln repair-- as well as demystifies the firing process. &nbsp;We want our students to be involved in every step of the ceramic process, a large part of that is firing. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"It's not us, it's you\" data-caption=\"It's not us, it's you\" data-id=\"16040086\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"It's not us, it's you\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/040/086/4ab6a71105516eed818f2ade90320fb4_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1490730148&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=96f83e0235f90799c9b43cb0407d7a22\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">It's not us, it's you</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Our venture is very low-risk.
