The snow is too deep and I can't use our community garden for a plant source.\n2.  There are no fans of my art tile.\nThe first challenge is easy to overcome.  You can buy absolutely everything from Amazon...including plants.  Check!\nThe second point is almost impossible to overcome.  No artist wants to hear that what they love to make is lovely only to themselves and no one else.  Totally a possibility...sigh...I will still make tile until I can't any longer...it's what I do.\n\n\"Find out who you are and do it on purpose\".
