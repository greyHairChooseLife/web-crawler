I take to both seriously and that is a fine act of balancing ( insert circus music here). &nbsp;We (mom &amp; dad) work together raising our fantastic family and designing our and producing our art/ceramic wares.&nbsp;</p><p>This project is exclusively about ceramics, as that is our burning passion (how fitting with hot kilns and such!) &nbsp;We (Joel &amp; I)have designed this great piece that we want to share with as many folks out there that would love to have one of there own to show off in their yard or patio. &nbsp;What it is now is a fantastic ceramic salmon which we have then molded to be slip cast. This is fired bisque, then glazed with a very glassy copper glaze (which comes out as a beautiful watery aqua color with lots of texture from crazing -a crackle look and highlighting sculptural elements of our fish.) This fish is then mounted inside another slip cast form in the shape of a wave to have the fish appear to be leaping out of the water. This \"wave\" piece is also what holds the bamboo stick that will enable you to stick the fish into the earth in your yard or into a pot on the patio. The \"Flaming\" aspect of the fish stick is an oil candle insert that is positioned into the mouth of the fish so one could light it up much like a Tiki torch. This insert we plan to use hold enough oil to burn for aprox. 3.5 hours.</p><p>We are so excited to have found Kickstarter to make this project really come to life! &nbsp;This is a fantastic opportunity for anyone to be an active part of our project and assist us in getting these fabulous fish out to everyone! &nbsp;They look so awesome and are a great addition to any yard- we think they would look great near a water feature!! The weather is good now here in Oregon &nbsp;(Famous for the wet rain)and we are ready to jump into immediate action of production upon successful funding;our outdoor studio is prime for full enclosure before the rain returns! The slip casting process really requires a temp. controlled enviroment to better facilitate the curing process.</p><p>&nbsp;Funds for this project are for the raw materials to make tons of fish, the glaze (which we mix ourselves and is featured on all our great rewards!), building materials for the studio upgrade and the finishing of the high fire kiln, (we have already built two kilns- bisque &amp; low fire),fulfilling rewards and fees</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">With the nature of ceramics and kilns, sometimes not everything in the load comes out as desired. The risk here is only a time delay in the arrival of your rewards. This would be a minor set back and you would be notified for any delay occurring.\r\nThe weather in Oregon at this time of year should not pose a problem to our conversion of outdoor studio to indoor. Although this may be a small time delay factor of completion. Again, updates will be sent out to keep everyone posted of progress!</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":13,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 1</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 1</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A Thank You card block printed by hand with an original design made by the creator and delivered via \"snail mail\" to you.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2014-10-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Oct 2014</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A mini wheel thrown planter with attached water catcher (approx. 3 inch X 3 inch - being hand thrown sizes are approx.)

Right straight into the mouth is an oil candle insert (That will burn any torch/candle fuel) with the flame burning out of the mouth of the fish. The tail end of the fish is to be cradled by another piece with a wave cut out in front and back of fish. This second piece has the same glaze as fish and is what the 'stick' is fixed to. The stick is also Bamboo (a renewable resource that holds up well outside!) This is made in a slip cast process explained in the video.
