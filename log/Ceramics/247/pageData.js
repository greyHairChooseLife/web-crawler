Having a place to work, equipment to use, and peers to encourage and critique can make anyone stronger and more passionate about the possibilities of clay.&nbsp;The Lititz Clay Studio is a place to serve all of those needs, and bring together likeminded people to not only grow as artists, but to share in the excitement of clay.&nbsp;</p><p>While my dream of having a community clay studio spans more than 10 years, the planning and preparation of the space has been taking place for the last 7 months. The final (and most costly) step of the process is all that remains, and I'm reaching out to the Kickstarter community for help with the purchasing of pottery wheels. The pottery wheel will be the most heavily used piece of equipment, as well as being the biggest draw for new students to the studio.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Many of the risks and challenges of starting Lititz Clay Studio came in  creating a functional space that can handle clay, glazes, and everything that comes with them. Now that all the renovations are complete, most of those hurdles have been crossed, and challenges moving forward are mainly ceramics-related. Being in a high school ceramics classroom for 12 years, I've seen just about all the mishaps and challenges of a clay studio, and feel confident that I can tackle whatever might be ahead of me. If and when there's a challenge too big, I'm blessed to have a network of peers and mentors that can get me through....
