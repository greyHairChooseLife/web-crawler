I truly want to help give my patrons a fabulous experience with a new building sooner rather than later, and have actual product to bring with me this fall. &nbsp;I have no clue how long this kiln will continue to fire and am forced to purchase a new one. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>With your support, I can continue to share my joy &nbsp;with others, continue to buy supplies (clay and glazes aren't free ;) &nbsp;and help beautify my lovely home faire all in one fell swoop. &nbsp;I would be eternally grateful for your support. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you and God bless.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\"
