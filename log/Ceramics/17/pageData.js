You will have (1) one year to redeem this reward that will arrive in the mail. Lessons may be given to someone else as a gift! (Age 16 or older). Lessons will be scheduled during our OPEN STUDIO hours and will be taught by Alex Adams (Tue: 10-4, Wed: 4-8, Sat: 12-4). \r\nYou will be able to schedule your lesson through Email: contact@aaclay.com or Phone: (502) 287-9666. Please let us know if you would prefer an individual or group lesson. Group lessons will be scheduled on Saturdays.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to shipping out lots of handmade medallions and mugs.

Alex creates stoneware pottery that is crafted with great scrutiny. Articulated forms are designed with a functional purpose in mind; wooden potter’s tools and artist-designed carved plaster stamps bring each piece to life. Subtle glazes break over stamp impressions to expose the creative energy that is stored in each handmade object.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1659451464,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":3,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.alexadamsclaywork.com","domain":"alexadamsclaywork.com"},{"url":"http://aaclay.com","domain":"aaclay.com"},{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/aaclaystudio","domain":"facebook.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/286/190/68a8e852d292631d43aff0fa9e4740f2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461574220&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=69e9c1b051ba23e815eb3b81a7514de3","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/aaclaystudio","top_cities_location_1st":"Louisville United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"34","top_cities_location_2st":"Chicago United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"3","top_cities_location_3st":"Lexington United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"2","top_cities_location_4st":"Nashville United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"2","top_cities_location_5st":"Moscow Russia","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_cities_location_6st":"Boulder United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Canton United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Cumming United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"De Kalb United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Evansville United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"58","top_countries_location_2st":"Russia","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","number_of_new_backers":33,"number_of_returning_backers":29}
