The pilot consisted of a contemporary wall installation of apothecary jars. It proved to be a huge success when it was then exhibited at Luton Hoo Walled Garden, Bedfordshire, while I was one of the resident artists. \n</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hosts?&nbsp;</span></p><p>Back in 1673 The Worshipful Society of Apothecaries founded Chelsea Physic Garden which is an extraordinary oasis in the heart of London’s busy Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea. <a href=\"http://www.chelseaphysicgarden.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">www.chelseaphysicgarden.co.uk</a>&nbsp;. Earlier this year a new Medicinal Garden was opened within its walls, and this new space contains both historical and contemporary medicinal plants, used to treat conditions throughout the world. The curator at Chelsea Physic Garden is keen to host ‘Curse or Cure?’ and sees it as an innovative project and a perfect match for The Garden and its many visitors. Unfortunately, because Chelsea Physic Garden is a Registered Charity it is unable to provide any financial support – so I’m on my own!</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Target?\n</span></p><p>Competition for  grants is extremely fierce in the UK at the moment, so as you can imagine, I was over the moon when the Arts Council England awarded me a ‘Grant for the Arts’ for ‘Curse or Cure?’ to be created for Chelsea Physic Garden.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The total budget for the project, which has been approved by Arts Council England, is for         £28 000. Their award will cover 50% of the funds needed to develop, produce and install the project within the Physic Garden’s New Medicinal Quadrant. I am now working towards raising the remaining funds through public and individual donations and hope to achieve this goal by October 2014 so that the exhibition and its educational events can run throughout 2015 and potentially for an indeterminate period.\n</p><p><span class=\"bold\">The project?\n</span></p><p>My son Merlin and I have made this film to show you the developmental pilot at Luton Hoo Walled Garden and  we hope that it gives you an insight into some of the processes that I will be using to create ‘Curse or Cure?’ for the new Medicinal Quadrant within Chelsea Physic Garden.&nbsp;\n</p><p>The primary objective of ‘Curse or Cure’ is to raise awareness and promote a wider understanding of our dependence upon plants used medicinally. This will be achieved through both visual and physical interaction with the installation &amp; trail set among the curative plants, and also with the use of digital technology.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Curse or Cure?’ focusses on the historic practice called the ‘Doctrine of Signatures’ - when something about the plant, such as its appearance, resembles the ailment that it was used to treat. For example Pulmonaria Officinalis (Lungwort) has oval spotted leaves symbolising ulcerated lungs, and was therefore used to treat pulmonary (chest) infections.\n</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"2088103\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/088/103/74dbc7f4f46f5af8948feb28b2b4cf2f_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1401715606&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ef7073d5c65e50552f7c5f6ce8ca0556\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>An emphasis is also put on 17th century recipes for remedy; some of which still form the basis for treatments today.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Who will benefit from the project?\n</span></p><p>I am aiming to inspire people of all ages both on and off site, and will be fully exploiting digital technology in an innovative way, to achieve my goal. ‘Curse or Cure?’ will engage with the 50 000 annual visitors to the Physic Garden, along with a further 3 500 educational visitors from schools travelling from in and around London, and from much further afield. Educational sessions along with special ‘Curse or Cure?’ events are an intrinsic part of the project.\n</p><p><span class=\"bold\">What’s in it for you?</span>\n</p><p>If ‘Curse or Cure?’ is fully funded not only will you feel great about contributing to what we believe is a meaningful project, but   I am also offering some reward gifts to show how much I really appreciate your support (however small) -  thank you!\n</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"2088119\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/088/119/9aa4a6e586b609912dd046244cf80dbb_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1401716020&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d4357a8998f0a68ab58c9c41d8e1d66a\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>Any pledges will not leave your account until my target has been reached!&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have produced work for more than forty selective shows since graduating as a mature student in 2007; some of these were group shows and involved securing collective funding. I also have a successful track record of exhibiting at selling fairs such as Art in Clay. For these I budget, fund, market and project manage as well design, construct and produce work for my stands. Working in this commercial sector, directly with the public, has given me invaluable experience of adhering to restricted budgets, contracts, deadlines and achieving consistently successful outcomes. \r\nIn 2009, I exhibited at the 'Art in the Garden' outdoor exhibition at Sir Harold Hillier Gardens, Hampshire. This required secured funding which was awarded through a GftA (Reference (URN):11641734). I successfully adhered to my projected budget, made evaluations throughout, and produced final reports for the ACE.  \r\nBoth strands of my experience merged when I began an Artist's Residency at Luton Hoo Walled Garden in 2010. This allowed me to start my research and enquiry into what became the self-funded developmental pilot for 'Curse or Cure?' The experience culminated in a three day exhibition selling the resulting work.  \r\nFor this current project I have researched the costs and time required based on prototypes. I have received quotations from all third-parties contributing to the project and will strictly work within the time and budgetary constraints that I have set out. I use spread sheets to monitor my budgets and monthly spending.\r\nI will be using the experience and services of the following professionals to ensure this project is fully realised:   \r\nDavid Oliver is an experienced photographer based in London. His recent clients include: Bank of England, BBC, English Heritage, National Trust, British Gas and Tate &amp; Lyle. I have regularly worked with David on images of my work. He is extremely creative as evidenced by his website. He will provide the website images and those used in the marketing material. He will also support QR code identification material. www.davidoliver.co.uk \r\nTim King is an Exeter based web designer currently working on a freelance basis with over 10 years experience across a variety of small businesses and major organisations. Tim is experienced in assisting artists and musicians in the manipulation, transcription and conversion of digital data using a combination of third-party tools and bespoke scripting. I have reliably used Tim to build my website and will use him for digital app. development and support for the QR codes. www.artapart.co.uk \r\nCatherine Davis is a Hertfordshire based cultural consultant. She has extensive experience within the visual arts since 1995. As Hertfordshire’s Arts Development Officer (2000 and 2011) she set the strategic direction of arts in the county. Since freelancing in 2011, she has completed a number of research projects and reports for clients including the Royal Opera House and Norfolk and Norwich Festival Bridge organisations Catherine will analyse the evaluation, produce the final report and its dissemination</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">£3</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 4</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>'Curse or Cure?'
