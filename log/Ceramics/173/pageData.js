We also know that public schools, like ours, often struggle financially and it's not easy to fund things outside of normal operations, so we've decided to act! Rather than asking our district for money, we decided to put our foot forward to show our commitment to art. We're excited to share our story with the community through Kickstarter. It's our mission to leave behind a legacy (we're graduating this year!) that will create opportunities for future students. &nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:what-youll-be-backin\" class=\"page-anchor\">What you'll be backing...</h1><p>What are we creating? For you, we're offering funding rewards of hand-made ceramic goods (see images just below). But what we're <i>REALLY</i> creating here, with your help, are opportunities... the chance for future students to experience full ceramics programming. &nbsp;We're seeking your help to raise funds for more advanced tools such as potter's wheels, improved ventilation for our kiln and other ceramic related items, which&nbsp;our annual art supply budget doesn't cover. Once we reach our goal, we'll immediately purchase these tools and equipment (please see our budget below), which will instantly expand our opportunities and broaden our experiences in ceramics. Not to mention all these great rewards we'll be able to make for our project backers! &nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Pledge and choose a sweet reward!\" data-caption=\"Pledge and choose a sweet reward!\" data-id=\"3363628\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pledge and choose a sweet reward!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/363/628/f103ea57b901ea01db0428e0b767203c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1425236437&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ddc9a04e6050a79abcb3e7f170cb39bb\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pledge and choose a sweet reward!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:support-from-our-loc\" class=\"page-anchor\">Support from our local community<span class=\"bold\">...</span>\n</h1><p><i>Heartwarmingly,</i> this project also gave us the opportunity to collaborate with other teachers, students, artists, organizations and individuals from our community.&nbsp;</p><p><i>First of all</i>, we collaborated with our music teacher<span class=\"bold\"><i> Mrs. Case and her Chamber Choir</i></span> on music for our video.
