In fact, they have something special in mind.  I did attach a picture of our celebration this morning.  Balloons were in order.</p>\n\n<p>In between tears of joy and big smiles, I'd like to take the opportunity to share thoughts from the art teacher ; )</p>\n\n<p>Oh, wow... Where do I begin?!  There is just so much to say, but right now all I can do is feel... I hope the feeling hit you too : )  IT'S HUGE!</p>\n\n<p>...the 'feeling' is nothing short of overwhelming on so many levels. Overwhelming gratitude, overwhelming excitement, overwhelming fondness....</p>\n\n<p>I NEED you to know how very very important what you did is.  You, all 79 wonderful of you, have empowered us.  You've empowered my students with the knowledge that they can dream and make those dreams come true.  That they can take matters into their own hands and act!  That people in the world do truly care about their well being and will get behind them to help create opportunities that can change their lives.</p>\n\n<p>You've empowered ME with confidence to keep moving forward.  I'm going to be honest with you... I had no idea how difficult teaching would be.  The ups and downs that come with this job is not something that a degree can prepare you for, especially in the arts.  So, thank you... You are now the army of 79, behind me cheering me on!</p>\n\n<p>And thank you for supporting the arts in education!!  As you know, or may not know, art struggles to stay in schools, as it is still often viewed as a non-essential.  I can honestly say, in my short time as an educator, that art is ABSOLUTELY essential.  Not for added value in terms of performance in other subject areas, not to provide a diverse electives selection or to make a school a more visually pleasing place... Art is essential as it gives students the opportunity to re-claim their creative selves (yup, first day of class I do an blind vote and most students don't believe they're creative.  Say what?!)  The process of art making develops character in ways that other disciplines don't provide (that's another conversation!).  It gives them the opportunity to use their hands and create something that didn't exist until they made it!  That is power!</p>\n\n<p>Ok, I'll stop talking your ear off : )\nPlease know how truly grateful I am to each and every one of you... What a great thing WE did!!</p>\n\n<p>We'll be in touch soon!  Can't wait to update you in the coming days!</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,\nSarah Abend</p>","nativeImages":[{"id":"SW1hZ2UtMzUxMjYz","url":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/1410306/posts/1195298/image-351263-original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=560&v=1428681302&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1674ebb6906eb10008f017b0c20e492b","__typename":"Image"}],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1428673006,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"4101.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"4655.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":79,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1428505646,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTExOTIzOTc=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"WE MADE IT!!!!!   ... & tune in, we'll be on the news Thursday morning ; )","publishedAt":1428505646,"pinnedAt":null,"number":6,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Sarah Abend & Students @ BCHS","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/007/074/554/79629e8b525ce23caf20e51c817d7d55_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461432749&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=0dff2bfef4826c9b8561368b9c9743b0","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p><b>Dearest amazing backers!!!</b></p><h1 id=\"h:are-we-dreaming\" class=\"page-anchor\">Are we dreaming?!?!  </h1><p>Together we did it!  We are SOOOO thrilled that the deal is sealed!  We'll receive funding to make the much needed improvements to our ceramics programming!  Yippee!!! </p><p>However, it's not too late to donate!  We have until 9:30 Friday morning to receive pledges : )  So, if you know anyone who was thinking of pledging, let them know that it's NOT too late!  The more we raise, the more ceramics materials we can purchase!  Like a clay extruder... or dare we say... another potter's wheel?!</p><p>Wow!  We will be busy artists in the coming days... lots of ordering, and creating to do!  Stay tuned as we'll keep you posted along the way!  Also, we'll be sending out messages soon to get specific info for rewards that you may have selected.  So, look out for that email : )</p><p> It's such an <b><i>UNBELIEVABLY heartwarming</i></b> feeling to have our community behind us!
