Thank you all again so much for your support. Quick update on shipping for the rewards! Apologies as I thought I would be able to get these all shipped out the weekend after the Kickstarter closed in early September, however I did not realize that Kickstarter collected the funds from people over the course of 2 weeks so their are some pledges that got canceled or were not fulfilled so I had to wait to see who the fulfilled pledges would be before shipping off the goods. The GOOD NEWS is that all Tier 1 and Tier 2 rewards were mailed out today (9/30) and the remaining rewards will be mailed out tomorrow (10/1)! You should all receive your rewards before the end of next week. I would love for you to POST and share photos of you enjoying your rewards on Facebook or Instagram and tag me!! I love to see items being loved and used in their new homes &lt;3  </p>\n<br>\n<p>Kiln update - Kiln was ordered back in July and will be arriving in mid to late NOVEMBER!!
