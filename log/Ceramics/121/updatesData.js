height, roughly 5.5 inches.  It's the width that is different. I like making both kinds and I am going to continue doing so, until someone yells a definitive \"NO!\" at me to stop one or the other.  Also the designs on these babies are random.   Although, I might use the same idea, it will be subject to change, depending on my mood.   And I will try different ideas all the time.  A friend and I are working on Edward Gorey-type designs for knitting bowls.  How

interesting, and I should probably photograph the process, but clay shrinks.  From wet, freshly off the wheel to the first firing and then in the finally firing where it is glazed.  It's not too bad,

etc.  What I am noticing is the shrinkage on the reddish clay body is a little more than on the white.  All this means is that I am not getting EXACTLY 20 ounces of liquid into the mugs.  I'm off by

sit and throw for about an hour and a half at a time.  For some reason, there is no good position for my foot when I am throwing.  Anyway....YAY!  And I can't thank all of you enough for making this
