Also due to less funding than we had anticipated.  This project is very complex and ambitious but I assure you that the ball is rolling and things are happening.</p>\n<p>The higher funding goal was not met but the project is absolutely still happening and we guarantee that you will receive the items you backed our project for.</p>\n<p>We have made our first dye/mold which is the salad plate. We still need to make the rest of the molds for the collection and this is moving slower because we are having to fund things ourselves when we have the money to spare.</p>\n<p>Since we are having some funding issues for dyes (molds) we have decided to send out salad plates first to give backers to our kickstarter campaign something special to enjoy while they wait for the rest of their order/collection to arrive. Also to reassure you that this is indeed happening!! We 100% guarantee that you will receive all of the items that you paid for.</p>\n<p>I will be sending out a link to a survey to pick colors for plates tomorrow. I will email you the link directly to ensure that you received it.  Please only respond to the survey in which you backed. For example if you backed the Dinnerware Set for 2 people then that is the survey you will fill out.</p>\n<p>Salad plates will be ready in September for pickup if you are local to the Portland area and do not want to have items shipped.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for your patience and understanding as we work to get this completely new form of manufacturing established in our studio. This is a huge transition/step with lots of moving parts. We really appreciate you, your patience, and your continued support of Peaches.</p>\n<p>warmly,</p>\n<p>Jules</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1638717816,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"20000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"22304.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":68,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1636816925,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMzNTkyMTM=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Incredible!
