The focus will be upon the textures, visualisation and sounds of the industry to help to create an exhibition that will challenge people’s view of what many may have considered a dying industry. <br><br>To engage children at two local schools to Valentine Clays HQ by setting a project to challenge the children to focus on how ceramics is part of our everyday life and the importance of this heritage and culture to Stoke-on-Trent. <br><br><span class=\"bold\">What will the installation consist of\n</span><br>The exhibition will consist of three very different elements:&nbsp;<br>~ Photography\n<br>To focus upon the textural aspects of the industry and the people working within it. The photographer Rosa Sienna Hardaker will look at capturing arty and textural focus pictures as well as portraits of the people within the ceramics world. She will also record the development of the school projects. <br><br>~ Sound\n<br>John Shapter from Healing Sounds Journeys will capture a variety of sounds taken from the industry that he will develop into a soundscape which will be played during the exhibition giving a very unique experience in helping to bring the industry to life. <br><br>~ Ceramics <br>Renowned local ceramic artist Philip Hardaker will be working with two local schools Our Lady’s Catholic Academy and Glebe Academy, both based in Fenton and close proximity to Valentine Clays. He aims to create two installations of tiles created by the 100 children (50 from each school) which will go on display during the exhibition and will then be donated to the school for them to display and enjoy. A competition will be set for the children to create a tile design based around the ceramics industry and Stoke-on-Trent, 50 winners from each school will then be chosen to recreate their design with Philip at the LoveClays workshop facility. <br><br><span class=\"bold\">How you can help\n</span><br>To ensure this project is a success and creates a buzz around the topic being promoted we need support from the ceramics industry so that we can capture the sounds and pictures from within the industry which will help us to create a story.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We also need sponsorship and further funding to help the artists involved in creating the ceramic installation to cover their costs. <br><br>In return for your support we will ensure that you get acknowledged on any promotional, marketing and PR that we do for the exhibition. You will also be invited to the private viewing event taking place on Friday 13th July 2018.\n<br><br><span class=\"bold\">Sponsorship/Funding</span> <br>Valentine Clays will provide the space, materials and firing facilities for the workshop sessions as well as the exhibition space and promotional activities at our own cost. <br><br>There is additional cost for the time of the three artist involved and we are looking to seek any help with ensuring that their costs are covered:\n<br><br>~ Philip Hardaker\n<br>To cover 10 full days delivering the project at a cost of £2,000. <br><br>~ Rosa Sienna Hardaker &amp; John Shapter <br>To cover their time and expenses a cost of £500 each is needed.<br><br>For further details contact Hannah Ault at info@loveclay.co.uk&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The only challenging we are finding is fundraising for this project and we feel that all artist involved should not be doing it out of their own pocket.
