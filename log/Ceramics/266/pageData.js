I live and travel the country in a small recreational vehicle with my pup Luna. I've been throwing pottery for 3 years and selling my wares on the road; from the top rack of my old volvo, off the side of my current rv, while pumping gas, and to generous friends I've met along the way (I'm so grateful for you). Recently, while staying in Tucson Arizona, my pottery wheel was stolen from a back yard. Shock, anger and surprise mingled with slight admiration? This was a heavy piece of machinery, and awkward. I've lugged it around enough of the country to know what a pain it is to move. So, who does that? How!? Why?? Whoever you are, I just hope you utilize it and don't sell for scrap. Please don't scrap my pottery wheel.</p><p>At first I was very upset; being stolen from, the setback to my livelyhood, and about losing a piece of equipment that brings me so much joy. Upon reflection I've realized that life must go on and there are always options. Sometimes even better options. My other wheel was so heavy, it's been difficult to take with me. It also required a lot of power, I couldn't even use it on many of the off grid locations where I've been spending time. The wheel I have my heart set on replacing it with is a \"shimpo aspire\". Shimpo is a trusted brand, they assemble solid machinery and are highly valued in the ceramics world.  My last wheel was a shimpo and I am a loyal to them. The \"aspire\" is a portable wheel, being only 25lb. It can center up to 20lb of clay &nbsp;and is only 100watts. It has amazing reviews from some of my favorite online tutorialists. The low weight and wattage would allow me to throw pottery off a small solar panel, or the rv's deep cell battery. This wheel would be the first step in creating a truly mobile throwing studio. I have the knowledge and equipment to harvest clay, and resources to fire and glaze.</p><p>I have been fairly hesitant at the idea of turning to my community for help on this. I know you all work hard for your money. You've earned it. I don't feel entitled to it in the slightest. I've been truly surprised by how many people have mentioned the idea of a kick starter. I turned to your opinion via Facebook and have been overwhelmed by the love and support received. If just one dollar were donated from each of my online friends I could buy three wheels. I actually only need one.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, for the encouraging words, and the back yard hangs! Thank you for helping me to keep the adventure alive, i truly can't wait to see you out there.</p><p>Xoxo Camille</p><p>Please feel free to view my Instagram@Camille_Casado for further photos of my work and travels.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"8609986\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/609/986/074744e22ddf5c36b2ddf8675a9ec121_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461534564&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6733b4ad958897462afe63e16f4b4816\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"8610406\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/610/406/66c49092009f958b8dc9ae75e739691e_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461534588&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e623741d826a5d3dfe493661783c632d\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"8610865\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/610/865/27152573855e57393586b859cdd64668_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461534610&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=aa2e505993b6f0013b9b7b9a584144c1\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The goal here is to be able to conveniently take my business on the road, which means bringing my studio with me. Having my wheel replaced by one I could travel with and use In any location would be an amazing first step, and all I am asking for. To bring my dream to life, however, there are still a few steps to go. \r\nBefore a pot is fired it is referred to as \"greenware\". Greenware is extremely fragile. Since I will be transporting my greenwares In to other studios for firing and glazing (for now this is the most effective option. There are many pre-existing spaces I can utilize for these steps) the greenware will require a safe/soft environment to nestle In to. This can be achieved through a lined cubby system I have designed and can build myself. Secondly, creating a similar space for my reclaimed clay bucket. Buckets filled with water are used to bring the clay back down to its purest smoothest state, then dehydrated using plaster bats, and finally wedged back in to itself to create wheel ready clay. Creating a personalized storage area for each of these items will take time, as I currently lack the funds to begin construction. However, having this wheel will allow me to earn the money I need to complete the dream. Until then, I will rely on my ingenuity and happily make do with what i have.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xNjEzMzU4MDI4","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":1,"number_of_comments_depth_all":0,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nDeveloping a mobile ceramics studio from a 1977 Toyota Chinook.
