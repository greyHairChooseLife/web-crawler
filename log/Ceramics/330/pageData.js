I am a multi-media artist that specializes in ceramics and I am graduating from college (finally!) and setting up my own studio to work out of. I have explored many different mediums in the course of my life, but my one true love has always been ceramics. I love to draw and will do it for fun, whenever the mood strikes, or by request as an illustrator; but ceramic art is where my heart is. I started playing with clay in 2001 and never stopped. No matter what I do or where I go, it always pulls me back.</p><p>I have been studying Fine Arts at the University level since 2014 and started publishing my work on Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook this year. The response I have received thus far has been fantastic and I have even managed to launch my business because of it. However, it has become difficult to keep up with demand when working around others' firing schedules, and I have had many issues with breakage of pieces because of a joint studio situation. That's why I launched this Kickstarter campaign to help me purchase and install a new kiln that I can run on my own and depend on to fill my orders. I have galleries and clients waiting for my work so I desperately need to get up and running!</p><p>With help from Kickstarter and my wonderful backers, I'm hoping that I can really launch myself and get my business the rest of the way off the ground. I am all in for this business. It's my life dream and goal to be successful in my art and I want desperately for it to work. All I need is a little help to get there. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Some of my Monster Cups, most of these are going into a show next month!\" data-caption=\"Some of my Monster Cups, most of these are going into a show next month!\" data-id=\"21288054\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Some of my Monster Cups, most of these are going into a show next month!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/288/054/d311c0efd00d4ac4a6cf66479f14a7a3_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1526761824&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ab02b5749681090fdeaf406fe7f296f7\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Some of my Monster Cups, most of these are going into a show next month!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Some of my basic mugs.

I already have my wheel and am in the process of making all of the items from the list (plus a bunch more!) I just need to be able to fire them. \r\n\r\nPreviously I had access to the University studios and kilns, but when I wrapped up my degree I lost access. There are group studios in town but they all operate on firing schedules of their own and charge by volume which puts them out of my price range. Not only that, but my sculptures are very delicate and tend to get broken in group firing situations. A kiln of my own would solve all of these issues and allow me to work on my own schedule at a cheaper rate.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":14,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 1</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 1</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nMy Adoration\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>There is no tangible reward for this option, but know that I will sing your praises (probably literally) for the rest of my days!</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2018-07-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Jul 2018</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nDigital 5 Page Coloring Book\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>5 black and white 8.5\" x 11\" pdf pages ready and waiting to be printed and colored.
