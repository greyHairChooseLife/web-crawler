I'm twenty years old, I attended The School of The Art Institute of Chicago for a short time before leaving due to financial reasons. I did not declare a focus but I was very interested in Fiber and Ceramics as well as Photo and Film. I am currently most interested in combining my passions for fiber and ceramics together and creating some beautiful pieces. I am most interested in making things influenced by various aspects of nature, currently I'm focusing on insects and the habitats they create for themselves. Unlike myself, my family is mostly focused on making functional pieces that are also beautiful. I do have an interest in making functional pieces, but that interest is outweighed by making pretty things.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Destiny Wormlight","creator_last_login":1517952487,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":0,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/633/773/5b784c3ae90dcb1ae43ad54f9f15121e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461401272&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=e794a391960af996d81a2fbcc0318bd2","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1055633678","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>I have a friend getting rid of everything needed to start a small ceramics studio. She's selling me everything quite cheaply, but my family and I are all living on very restricted income. We all have experience working with clay, but don't really have a lot of extra time or money for studio time. Having an in home ceramic studio will give us the flexibility we need to be able to spend time as a family while creating art we all love and possibly make a little extra money to further our flexibility. We are all very passionate about creating beautiful things and would love to be blessed with such a beautiful gift like this.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Since everything is used, there is a possibility for wear and tear to things like the kiln to affect production. Thankfully we have enough of a support system that will cover any repairs that we need. The building the studio will be in is a separate garage with great ventilation but the wiring in the building has given us a little cause for concern. We are already getting an electrician to look at everything to make sure we can safely operate the kiln and wheels before we start anything.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 1</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 1</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A nice handmade thank you card from my family and I.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-09-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sep 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>One elegant handmade chopstick rest, made in the new studio.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-11-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Nov 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 20</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A basic hand made ceramic mug made in the new studio.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-11-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Nov 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n2 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (18 left of 20)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>One set of handmade ceramic dining ware made right in the new studio.
