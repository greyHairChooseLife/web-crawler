recently graduated from Penn State University with an MFA in Ceramics.&nbsp; My work stems from my memories of growing up as one of 12 children in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp; Through the use of various objects, I aim to construct information rich installations that speak of my experiences.&nbsp; I enjoy seeing these objects evolve through the use of clay just as a story of an event can change over time in the ways of telling it. &nbsp;As a Mexican American, I hope to render a narrative that seeks to embrace and celebrate these rituals of a new generation. My interest in creating&nbsp;pieces based on my&nbsp;heritage and family traditions arises from my fear of these processes being lost and forgotten. &nbsp;Ceramics as a material has permanence; it is one of the ways we were able to learn about ancient cultures. &nbsp; There is beauty in these traditions and my aim is to make a mark in my time that will be preserved in the history of ceramic objects.</p><p>I have been accepted into a short-term residency at\nArquetopia in Puebla Mexico.&nbsp; Arquetopia is an award winning, self-sustaining non-profit foundation and is unfunded by outside entities.&nbsp; As such, residents finance their own programs.&nbsp; I hope to fund this Kickstarter so\nthat I can travel to Puebla Mexico and participate in their ceramics residency\nin the spring of 2015.&nbsp; This residency will be a great opportunity to expose\nmyself to the richness of Mexican culture as well as the diverse cultures of its&nbsp;residents\nthat may in turn stimulate my creative process. &nbsp;As part of this residency I will be able to collaborate with Talavera\nworkshops, a traditional ceramic processes well known in Puebla.&nbsp; I am\ninterested in&nbsp;furthering my education&nbsp;by learning new methods and\ntechniques so that I can embrace them in&nbsp;my own work.&nbsp; I strive to&nbsp;continuously\nrefine &amp; evolve my art. Keeping a dialogue with fellow artists has been\nvital to my growth as an artist and this residency will allow me &nbsp;to\nmake connections with a variety of international artists&nbsp;working in\nvarious mediums. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, please take a look at my work in the video above. &nbsp;I appreciate your\nsupport on this project.</p><p>Every Donation receives a gift in exchange :)</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC01MjI2MTE3MTk=","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":2,"number_of_comments_depth_all":3,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nHi there, thank you for visiting my page.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/953/746/f25fc43c8746199d5c5c12ca16e92cd2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463718918&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=36b8cde7f9cc3dae259985bde0542c7d","last_updated":"May 6, 2015","project_name":"nchiladas Montadas?","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"3,213","amount_of_pledged":"3,340","number_of_backers":"25","rate_of_funded":103,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Puebla, Mexico","creator_name":"Christina Erives","creator_location":"Los Angeles, CA","creator_description":"Christina Erives was born in 1989 in Los Angeles, California.

She is currently a visiting professor at New Mexico State University and plans to attend Red Lodge Clay Center in Montana followed by Arquetopia’s short term residency in Puebla Mexico in spring of 2015.   Erives’ work focuses on her memories of growing up as one of twelve children in Los Angeles, California.  Using magical surrealism and extreme attention to detail, Erives constructs information rich installations that speak of her experience as a Mexican-American.
