My love for glaze chemistry in college led to my full time job as a chemist for Continental Clay in Minneapolis Minnesota.  I'm fortunate because my employer allows me to take time off to teach Raku pottery workshops and Artist in residency programs in Mid West.  Through my teaching I have been able to reach out and help so many individuals and institutions strengthen their programs in today's economic issues.  I take time out of my busy schedule to deliver clay and materials to schools in my areas for free so they can take the money for shipping and re-purpose it back to their students.  Over the past four years I have brought professional artist to my local school for in house workshops so the students can see how Artists develop their craft in their local regions and countries.  Every place that I teach is enriched and helped while I am there, from learning about new programs, rebuilding kilns, helping educators and administrators find more creative ways to keep strengthen their programs, and save money.  In New Richmond Wisconsin I built a Community Pottery Studio with little backing into a facility that is similar to those found at college campuses.  I feel that you get out of your community by what you put into it.  Its a philosophy that was instilled into be by my parents and I find that the gratification of helping others is a gift like no other.  I have helped out with the local Empty Bowls fundraiser for the local food-shelf for the past seven years.  My help in securing the donations of clay from my company, and the community Building Day have helped raise more than $500,000 in food for the local people in need.  I have also built and left kilns for schools so the teachers could continue to have a ceramic program.  Through my teaching I find equipment that is being disposed of by institutions, refurbish, and donate it back to those who need it.  i hate to see kilns or bricks up in a land fill so I salvage them and give them on to those who need and can use them.  I left two Raku kilns at Renville County West High School during an Artists in residency so the teachers could continue to fire and teach their students about this special type of firing.  By helping others I am helping myself be more in tune with my community and the gratitude of knowing I can make a difference is what keeps me going.\r\n\r\nPotters Without Kilns is the next phase for the Community pottery studio and my desire to help.  Recent college graduates are facing insurmountable debt and low paying jobs that its going to take them a lifetime to acquire the equipment and materials I am currently getting for the programs I am helping to succeed.  If we don't reach out and lend a hand we are going to loose a lot of talented people who can make a difference in someones life.  I can't wait by and see these artist fail due to financial concerns.  Someone helped me by supporting me when no one else would, and I have never forgotten that act of kindness, now I teach others to do the same.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1412005436,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":2,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://potterswithoutkilns.com","domain":"potterswithoutkilns.com"},{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/mark.lusardi.94","domain":"facebook.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/936/843/3941a4b92813e1b31c918cf8e82029d2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461550677&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c850d4a27f5c654c0fdcb0d971ac25e8","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/2100274027","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"2427501\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/427/501/4385ef08626d16351a54c47daba6fedd_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1407903010&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f9a3a48915c2145127284c81757327e9\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">&nbsp;The Potters Without Kilns Program</span></p><p>Potters Without Kilns was founded by Mark Lusardi in 2013. This is the culmination of a dream to help emerging artists find a place to fire their work. Potters Without Kilns is an extension of an evolving community of artists who feel strongly about providing a foundation for recent graduates as well as those who are transitioning from place to place.  The program offers education, equipment, and materials, that would take too long to acquire and would be too expensive for emerging artists to maintain. This is why we are seeking your assistance to finalize the funding necessary to build a barn for the kilns and equipment.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Potters Without Kilns – How the Kilns Were Acquired</span></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"2428828\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/428/828/faca727068852a30eb8ba4ab5975f31a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1407931376&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6fd44bbb7965f01aee66e60d52c8a0df\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Mark recently purchased potter Carl Erickson’s large reduction gas kiln. It was an unexpected offer from Carl’s wife and dear friend, Rebecca, after Carl’s passing in 2011 from pancreatic cancer. The kiln is also a gift from Mark’s father, who passed away four months after helping pay off the balance. The purchase of Carl’s kiln is very humbling because it is from a potter who inspired many artists in his lifetime. Carl was a master craftsman whose attention to detail was apparent in every aspect of his work.                              \n\n</p><p>In October of 2013, Mark was privileged to receive potter Warren MacKenzie’s original salt kiln that was built in 1968.  Warren is renowned for his work and his passion to help fellow potters.  It’s gratifying to own this kiln and with it Potters Without Kilns will continue to help the next generation of artists. \n\nOld kilns have a story to tell and people need only take the time and listen. This project has ignited a fire in the potters of the area.  From emerging artists to credited international potters in the community, folks are helping to make this project a reality. Join us and be part of the legacy.\n\n</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"2428830\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/428/830/97ba4241ec70b28f7f62263f9157e606_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1407931458&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2817736f136ca66f8611eca0c1511189\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Potters Without Kilns – The Barn Project</span></p><p>The building of the barn is the essential aspect of this fundraising campaign and will allow Warren and Carl’s kilns to be protected and fired for many years to come. We have already secured $90,000 in kilns, burners, safety equipment, ventilation system, utilities, glazes, and materials. We need your help in raising the money for the barn. \n\nIf we reach our fundraising goal, the kilns will be housed in an 18x26-ft timber-frame building with metal roofing, pine siding, and an open interior.  The barn will have two sets of double doors for easy access, a side stall and loft for additional storage.\n\n</p><a href=\"http://www.countrycarpenters.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Country Carpenters 26 ft one story barn\" data-caption=\"Country Carpenters 26 ft one story barn\" data-id=\"2428840\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Country Carpenters 26 ft one story barn\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/428/840/7a82d4844102861d4f3250ff54fce78b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1407931588&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=c756ce8cbdf35fb4a303b25ddcc9d9f3\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Country Carpenters 26 ft one story barn</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"2443223\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/443/223/3eac26ce3c9504e4b9bd284d9f89b2a3_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1408193281&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a0396cd168d69c107c65ed20e3f95d97\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a>\n\n<p>The Stories these Kilns can tell. &nbsp;Hear, Listen, join us and be part of the legacy</p><p>Project.</p><p>Stage one is in progress. &nbsp;We are moving an existing building, and clearing the site of obstacles. Getting the Building Permit, which has been preapproved by my township and the Zoning department. I believe in research ahead of time minimizes suprises later on. &nbsp;I also have all the cost down for the utilities, cement, roofing, barn, site preparation, contractor, insulation, electrical, and the kiln materials to finish the project.</p><p>Stage two: &nbsp;Grade and prep the site for the foundation. This includes removing stumps, applying an aggregate base, laying out the footings, and metal for the concrete slab that will be poured in late September once we reach our funding level.</p><p>Stage three: &nbsp;Pay the deposit for barn and work with Country Carpenters to finish the building plans so they can start cutting the materials for the kit.</p><p>Stage four: &nbsp;Staging the materials and preparing for the delivery of the barn. Pouring the foundation and laying the first course of blocks for the sill plate of the barn to set on. &nbsp;Dismantle of another donated kiln,chimney stack and bricks from another potter that have to move to the site location for the rebuilding of.the two kilns, and now a third one.</p><p>Stage five: &nbsp;building the barn and working with the local contractor, and the building inspector, making sure everything moves along safely as possible. &nbsp;Once everything is set we should have the barn up and finished by late October early November. &nbsp;The barn is set up first with the raising of the frame, then the installation roof, then the siding doors and windows. &nbsp;Once everything is up we williams tall the electrical components, insulate and Sheetrock &nbsp;the interior, install the ventallation system, and plumb in the gas for the kilns.</p><p>Stage six: &nbsp;Rebuilding the kilns, and &nbsp;finish the set up of burners, safety systems, and build storage racks for storage. &nbsp;Set up the glazing area and heating system. &nbsp;Move in all the glaze making chemicals kiln shelves, post, and kiln doors.</p><p>Stage seven: &nbsp;Final walk through with the building inspector. &nbsp;Test fire the kilns. &nbsp;Do a walk through with Warren MacKenzie, Marjorie Wade, and some close friends before we get ready for the first firing.</p><p>Finish the purchase gifts, and prepare for mailing.&nbsp;</p><p>Step eight: First Firing Celebration. &nbsp;This will be determined by the weather. &nbsp;If its an early winter we will have the grand opening in May so that its easier for more people to attend. Place the donor plaque on the wall of the barn, along with a group photo. &nbsp;After the opening we will get the final picture printed and mail off the purchase gifts in early June.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a big project that has been underway for several years acquiring the kilns and necessary material, but the barn is the hardest obstacle for us to get going, with your help we can bring this new firing facility on line and ready for the potters of the St. Croix river valley, Minneapolis and St. Paul region. &nbsp;Come make this a reality for so many artists.</p><p>Thank you,</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have worked on several large projects over the years from organizing professional workshops, setting up a Community Pottery Studio at my local Community Commons in New Richmond Wisconsin, and teaching  several Artists in residences  throughout the Mid-West.  The one important thing about any endeavor like this is planning and to make sure you have everything in place, by contacting the zoning, building inspector, electrical, contractor, site location, and detailing each part of the project to minimize any set backs.  The only set back that could slow the building process is an early winter, but once the foundation is in place and the building is up we can build the kilns without worry of being in the elements.  This project is gathering a lot of support from the Ceramic community and once the funding is in place we have multiple professionals standing by waiting to help see this project become a reality.  \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMark Lusardi</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":12,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Breaking Ground! your name on one of the 2800 bricks that will be used to rebuild the kilns.
