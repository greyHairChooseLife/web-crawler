If you ever really get to know Mark you know that he is generous to a fault. In fact, I have a story that really sheds light on Mark Lusardi.</p><p>After I was awarded a McKnight Fellowship, I was able to buy a mid-sized gas fired car kiln from a potter in Hudson, WI. The idea was that I would take down the kiln, load it onto pallets, load the pallets onto a huge flatbed trailer and haul it back to St. Paul, where it would ultimately be rebuilt, et al. I hired a truck, the trailer and a crew of workers to help me do the job. The task proved to be enormous, far more expansive and demanding than I had anticipated. We loaded the trailer to its capacity and found that we still had several pallets of hard brick to bring back to St. Paul. Mark Lusardi had heard about my purchase of the kiln and he simply showed up in Hudson to help, uninvited. I welcomed his help, and help he did - all day long! the only thing he would let me do was buy him some lunch along with my hired crew. He refused gas money or any pay for his labor and I've got to tell you, Mark really knows how to get after it.</p><p>At the end of the day, I made arrangements with the Hudson studio, allowing me to pick up the rest of my bricks a few days later. Well, a day later, Mark Lusardi calls and informs me that he's picked up the bricks for me - HE LOADED THEM HIMSELF - because, in his thinking, he was coming through St. Paul anyway, on his way to work at Continental Clay. So he shows up with my bricks, which have pretty much maxed out the enclosed trailer he's pulling with an SUV. He tells me matter-of-factly that that's what friends do...</p><p>That was in 2008. Fast forward to this past May, for an end-of-the-semester party I annually throw for my art students. For the 2nd year in a row, Mark brings his traveling raku kiln setup to my house, providing bisque, glaze, equipment, combustibles - the whole damn deal - so we can have a raku party. I know what this kind of set-up/demo/workshop costs ($1000+), and yet he does it for only $300! Again, because we're friends, and he appreciates the fact that I put on this annual event for any of my students - current or past - who want to attend. It's become a big event and Mark instructs these students and kids and families from my NE Mpls neighborhood, firing over and over, past midnight, until everyone gets a chance to see their piece/s through the entire process. Mark was magnificent. But I assure you, Mark did it, and continues to do this same sort of thing for his friends at Lakeview, or New Richmond, or wherever he sees the need.</p><p>Now, Mark is doing something extraordinary for the clay community, and yet I have heard some people questioning his motives. To those who would decry Mark's efforts in this Potters Without Kilns initiative, I say take the time to investigate this very worthy endeavor. Or, at least shut up, which is what I have to tell Mark to do sometimes, because when he's excited about something, he can go on and on. But this is what I know about Mark: he can talk the talk, but HE SURE AS HELL WALKS THE WALK. Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, I have never met a more generous man in the clay world than Mark Lusardi. Sign me up, Mark</p><p>Much peace, Marko Fields</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1409233942,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTk2NzY4Nw==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"$700 Donation gift","publishedAt":1409233942,"pinnedAt":null,"number":4,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Mark J Lusardi","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/936/843/3941a4b92813e1b31c918cf8e82029d2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461550677&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c850d4a27f5c654c0fdcb0d971ac25e8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>This is one of the Tea Bowls that was at the closing of Warren MacKenzie's kiln and will be at the Closing of Carl Erickson's kiln and the opening firing of the new barn..  We have a total of 25 that are available along with a set of nesting bowls from McKnight Artist Kimberlee Joy Roth, a brick from the firing chamber of Warren's Salt kiln, and a set of coaster tiles made from the bricks that cannot be used in the rebuilding of Warren's kiln.  this is a wonderful package and a great way to connect to the project. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Raku Tea Bowl from the closing of the kilns\" data-caption=\"Raku Tea Bowl from the closing of the kilns\" data-id=\"2500437\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Raku Tea Bowl from the closing of the kilns\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/500/437/7655624256ec9161ca8fd086ee31c364_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1409233889&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7042cb74ae899f37b455f268f6395ae0\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Raku Tea Bowl from the closing of the kilns</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1409233410,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTk2NzY4Mw==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Shout out!","publishedAt":1409233410,"pinnedAt":null,"number":3,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Mark J Lusardi","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/936/843/3941a4b92813e1b31c918cf8e82029d2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461550677&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c850d4a27f5c654c0fdcb0d971ac25e8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Shout out and warm Thank you to Karen Brown, Chad Jerzak, Natasha, Patricka L Barr, Paul Koch, and Karen Anderson.  We are on the way and so many of you have helped get the work out, and its working.  A lot of artist feel that this is an awesome program and can't wait to see it become a reality.  </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1408975678,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTk2NDAxNQ==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Shout Out!","publishedAt":1408975678,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Mark J Lusardi","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/936/843/3941a4b92813e1b31c918cf8e82029d2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461550677&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c850d4a27f5c654c0fdcb0d971ac25e8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Thank you Shout out to the following backers!</p><p>Coleen Riley, Bob Briscoe, Jessie Wade, Lisa Staples, Janet Suter, Pow!
