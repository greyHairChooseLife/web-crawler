To be honest, the cost and time of the production was more than we anticipated for and have therefore had to stagger the delivery of the rewards to allow production to continue for our regular clients as well.  We launched our online sales today to help to keep money flowing into the business, in no small part to fund the fulfillment of the kickstarter rewards.  \n\nWe are so grateful to the support of folks like yourself and believe me when I say that everyday that passes we are doing our best to get finished work out to you.  \n\nI really do apologize for the delay and hope that you understand.  Rewards will be shipping out very soon.\n\nThank you for your support and for your patience and we promise you will be enjoying the fruits of your support before long.\n \n </p><p>Now, where did your money go??</p><p>We have made several trips out to Denver to purchase and oversee the shipping of a beautiful Ram Press.  Its glorious!
