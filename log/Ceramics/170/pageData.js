The mass production of ceramics has caused a decline in quality, craftsmanship, color, and relevant contemporary design. At DeLind Ceramics Company (DCC), we reject this loss of creativity in functional ceramics, and fundamentally believe that high design in clay creates something non-disposable which will endure the test of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Pitcher Produced Circa 2012\" data-caption=\"Pitcher Produced Circa 2012\" data-id=\"3687459\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Pitcher Produced Circa 2012\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/687/459/90b91cdc1f315afd4efd70ded87c8842_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1430165799&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=937df76008429ccd4a926f17aa6dc7df\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Pitcher Produced Circa 2012</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Our company is based in Detroit, a vibrantly recovering city of opportunity which has an abundance of the youth, creativity, and quality of craftsmanship required to successfully launch a new name in ceramics!&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Bisque Fired Tile Pattern\" data-caption=\"Bisque Fired Tile Pattern\" data-id=\"3687491\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Bisque Fired Tile Pattern\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/687/491/720a2a5b53701c02a9d0ab8a326510d7_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1430166102&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ba7a22977bfec18d251a53de7f012471\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Bisque Fired Tile Pattern</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>DCC produces both functional and architectural ceramic products through the time tested methods of tile pressing, slip casting, hand building, and wheel throwing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Upon reaching full operational goals, we plan on investing back into our community through open studio time and educational workshops for the community and students, as well as partnerships with our neighborhood schools.

Even when up and running at full production capacity, our clay process takes many months from our fresh mixed medium to our finished product! Many people don't realize that high quality ceramics have multiple firing cycles, each of which requires its own specialized kilns with very specific operating constraints. A single piece of malfunctioning equipment in our system can throw off our entire production line. While the ability to be very creative and fluid with the artisanal nature of our product is what DCC prides ourselves in, a functional ceramics company must rely on many of the same principals as any heavy industrial manufacturer. \r\nPaired with their creative ideas, our founding members have backgrounds in engineering, manufacturing, and business. Rather than buy premade products, we have designed and have begun building kilns that will accommodate multiple uses, presses that function to our specifications, and a studio full of machinery that we know how to service, tune up, and improve to meet all of our client’s needs. Our manufacturing backgrounds allow us to look at the various stages of product differentiation and build our process to minimize material and time losses, due to product changes, with an analytical process that others in our field just cannot compete with. Finally we have critically analyzed the funding goals we require to maintain a functional cash flow (based on projected expenses) through our first three years of setup and branding, which allows us to avoid the funding  pitfalls any poorly prepared small businesses will inevitably encounter.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xOTc4MTMxMzY4","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":5,"number_of_comments_depth_all":6,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nEveryone should have high quality ceramics tile, functional wares, and architectural accents as part of their daily lives.\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/991/697/001ebe39e1ce1a7bebd7d6cf8df100ab_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463722127&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=7a14b1be25106897b99c75a7dd30b35b","last_updated":"July 13, 2016","project_name":"eLind Ceramics Compan","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"$","amount_of_goal":"7,500","amount_of_pledged":"7,604","number_of_backers":"58","rate_of_funded":101,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Detroit, MI","creator_name":"David DeLind","creator_location":"Detroit, MI","creator_description":"I have and always will be an artist and designer at heart.
