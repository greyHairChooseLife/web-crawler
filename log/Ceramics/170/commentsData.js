If you want to maximize interest in this project, you should go back and include photos in the About section.  Ideally involving examples of the rewards, but also, just to show people what they're taking a chance on when they're just quickly browsing through.  The website you have listed isn't developed yet, so the Facebook page is really the only avenue to get an idea off of right now, and for your casual Kickstarter browser, there's not a whole lot to go on.","createdAt":1430115350,"author":{"id":"VXNlci01NjY1ODM3OTU=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/070/360/32f4b9343c198eb88cadf295aa7b7b71_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1461500793&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=95800b9833f0ff4233d3bc4c74be1cee","name":"Ashes","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/moondog"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}}]
