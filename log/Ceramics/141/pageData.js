The same way so many other people end up in Santa Fe.&nbsp;This is our story:</p><p>In 1983 I journeyed to Santa Fe to attend a pottery workshop taught by the oldest great granddaughter of renowned Pueblo potter Maria Martinez: Barbara Gonzales.  I was an artist, showing my work and curating shows in the East Village and Soho, but the Southwest and Pueblo cultures had always fascinated me.</p><p>Those were heady, wonderful times to be in New York, but something about Santa Fe and New Mexico captured my spirit, and stayed with me after I left. I could see myself taking my performance art to the desert, driving a turquoise pick-up truck to the cliffs at Bandelier National Monument near the birth of the atomic bomb to build Barbie doll dream house tableaus under petroglyphs 1,000 years old. I've always favored spirituality laced with a bit of irony. And of course, I could work with all that wonderful clay!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Cliff face at Bandelier National Monument, outside Santa Fe\" data-caption=\"Cliff face at Bandelier National Monument, outside Santa Fe\" data-id=\"4295079\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Cliff face at Bandelier National Monument, outside Santa Fe\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/295/079/c50cbe2b72614fd5c4a7ae55eeb25656_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1439252930&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7ebcf2967fb6db189983dad0c7bd3be3\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Cliff face at Bandelier National Monument, outside Santa Fe</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>But life had other plans; I met and married the love of my life, and put things western and Santa Fe to the side for a very long time.</p><p>Santa Fe is a siren, and she's patient. Once experienced, she starts singing in your blood. And New Mexico is justly famous&nbsp;as the place Georgia O'Keeffe and a small pantheon of artists found the solitude they craved. Its achingly blue skies and red mud cliffs became the bowl in which many caught their own designs. It's a place that invites you to move in and discover your own stories.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Smoke Fired Turquoise Bird Fetish Bowl - Reward and Art Print\" data-caption=\"Smoke Fired Turquoise Bird Fetish Bowl - Reward and Art Print\" data-id=\"4289655\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Smoke Fired Turquoise Bird Fetish Bowl - Reward and Art Print\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/289/655/ca936b3c614488fc885ac4a9db3a2cbf_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1439180627&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=0c7efc763756badf3b2bb3523a63ea40\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Smoke Fired Turquoise Bird Fetish Bowl - Reward and Art Print</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>2013 brought with it a chance for me to return to Santa Fe. I brought my husband too, my heart in my mouth, thinking he'd not like it much. Too quiet, too earthy. And I wondered, East Coast gal that I'd become, if I'd still feel the same pull.&nbsp;</p><p>But fears are silly things, because as I once had, he fell in love with New Mexico and Santa Fe. As did I, all over again. Fell in love as we stood in Georgia O'Keeffe's White Place near Abiquiu, visited her home and studio, studied her fabled views. Fell in love as we received blessings painted on us with feathers and sacred earth.  Fell in love with the hush of snow on Canyon Road and the food, oh yes the amazing food! at the annual Art Feast.</p><p>And then, we found the house.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Kiva Fireplace Holiday Card\" data-caption=\"Kiva Fireplace Holiday Card\" data-id=\"4299802\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Kiva Fireplace Holiday Card\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/299/802/626edd1eb1fa544e96d28fc6f61eb5e9_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1439317933&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b9944a09d6f001a63a9984fc70e0e6be\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Kiva Fireplace Holiday Card</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>And not just any house. Nestled into the foothills of Cerro Gordo (Fat Hill in Spanish, so romantic!) the little adobe home with its thick, sloping and polished walls and cozy kiva fireplace was used in the early 1900's by the artist Sheldon Parsons to house visiting guests. Parsons was an East Coast transplant himself, had come to New Mexico for his health. A successful portrait painter in New York (from Rochester, where my husband spent his childhood),&nbsp;once in Santa Fe he turned to landscapes, working out of a studio in the basement of the Palace of the Governor's before moving to Cerro Gordo to build his home and studio. He was the first director of what is now the New Mexico Museum of Fine Art, an active member in what became the Santa Fe School. And he was a rebel. Tossed out of his Director's job for being too \"progressive\" in his artistic views.&nbsp;</p><p>Our kind of guy.</p><p>We did what silly people do when they're in love. We bought Sheldon Parson's guest house.</p><p>Today, informed by the spirit that brings us all from one place to another, seeking our stories and a means to express them, we've conceived the Cerro Gordo Collection. Each item in the Collection seeks to embody something of New Mexico's clarity of light, fragrance and sound. Choose lavender from our garden, or a one of a kind bowl I've made using Pueblo slip and stone burnishing methods I first learned in the Southwest, inset with turquoise fetishes, buttons and arrowheads. Or choose a great canvas tote bag (made even more necessary by Santa Fe's new 10 cent bag fee) and take our kiva fireplace with you everywhere. We're also making art cards and postcards for the holidays.</p><p>Our plan is to launch the Collection website some time in late October or November. We hope to have items by other Santa Fe artists we admire as well. We've already met some amazing people and each year we volunteer at the International Folk Art Market, so we'll start to shop going forward with an eye to sharing some very intriguing things from around the world, made by amazing people who typify what one means by the words \"Santa Fe Style\".&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That's all great, you're thinking ... but why does this all need a Kickstarter?</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Smoke-fired, hand burnished spirit bowl with turquoise buttons\" data-caption=\"Smoke-fired, hand burnished spirit bowl with turquoise buttons\" data-id=\"4412356\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Smoke-fired, hand burnished spirit bowl with turquoise buttons\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/412/356/5d352de1fdb5c027a521ad4aa6ce98c6_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1441034374&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=375c9a5b92189377d30391a146148011\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Smoke-fired, hand burnished spirit bowl with turquoise buttons</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This October, I'll be spending 2 weeks in Santa Fe to make new fetish bowls (the turquoise birds and beads all come from a trading post in Cerrillos, a former mining town now being rejuvenated by a group of artists) and I'll harvest the lavender in my garden. I plan to seek new stories, meet new artists to feature in the Collection and photograph their work. As I type this I'm in Santa Fe for Market Week, and have met some incredible young artists whose work I'd like to promote. Come October, hopefully, I'll slow down enough to see what the walls have to say, explore the art made by others who came to Santa Fe and enjoyed Parson's hospitality while painting their way into the history of Southwestern Art, meet more new rising stars.</p><p>Our immediate funding goal covers use of a ceramic studio in Santa Fe where I can raku fire my fetish pots outdoors, airfare, rental car, gas and food (I don't eat much) as well as our web hosting costs for one year.</p><p>Our long term goal is much larger:</p><p>Keeping a 120 year old adobe home (which we've rechristianed The Casita at Cerro Gordo) alive and well and functional isn't always easy, especially when you're not there much of the time. What were we thinking? Our plan was always to share it with like-minded guests, we weren't silly enough to think we could retire any time soon, but the proceeds don't really cover our costs. If we can grow The Cerro Gordo Collection, any profit can help keep the house available for artists and writers looking for somewhere special to spend time in Santa Fe, and at the same time offering a place for them a virtual storefront to sell what they produce if so inclined. It's tastefully updated with all manner of silly luxuries like a new hotel quality king bed, Frette linens, stone-faced shower and Jacuzzi tub. We have radiant heat in our brick floors, central air when it's hot. Our kitchen is worthy of a chef (one of us happens to be a professional one). We restored the backyard, a once steep, barren dirt hill that was eroding away to nothing, planting a garden of native plants, including five kinds of lavender, an oasis for hummingbirds and honey bees. It's an unexpected sanctuary close to the galleries and shops of Canyon Road. Sitting in the garden under the arching blue bowl of the New Mexican sky with the soft sound of our well-fed rock fountain is a joy we love to share.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Garden at The Casita\" data-caption=\"Garden at The Casita\" data-id=\"4300260\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Garden at The Casita\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/300/260/49d22f3560fdf51159e0e71341f3a484_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1439322208&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6d62e2d3d9fe35b2f5c4c7e1353d6c87\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Garden at The Casita</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Bowls are truly sacred things.

Gordo Collection in time for holiday shopping in mid-October, and by supporting us now you get first choice of the limited edition hand-made ceramic bowls from our inaugural season. You'll also help us start to create the ongoing resources to keep The Casita at Cerro Gordo what it was and can continue to be, a place for travelers to dream wonderful dreams in the clear, crisp Santa Fe air. \r\n\r\nIn reality there are few real risks for our supporters; my plane ticket is purchased, a rental car and ceramic studio reserved. You know I have a place to stay and I'll share: I don't eat much (heh). If we're funded, you will get your rewards. I've been on Kickstarter for a few years and I love being part of this community and so many people's dreams. I know what it feels like to get excited by something, about something, and then get let down by non-delivery. That's not going to happen.\r\n\r\nWe have printers for the things that need printing, and we've kept our limits low on one of a kind rewards so as not to over-promise on things we have to make by hand.\r\n\r\nWe've also added one experiential award in case you want to stay at the Casita and drink it all in yourself; we'll take care of the lodger's tax and cleaning fees customary for staying in our home and add a sunset tour with our favorite guides, because no trip to Santa Fe or New Mexico is complete without our legendary sunsets. You'll see why.\r\n\r\nThank you, and we look forward to having you with us as we launch the Cerro Gordo Collection.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMDc1MzQ4OTcw","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":21,"number_of_comments_depth_all":5,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nThis October in Santa Fe marks the start.
