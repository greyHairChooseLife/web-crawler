I had been trying to keep the rewards simple and straight forward, but maybe many options would be better. Maybe there will be some late reward options posted soon. ;) Thanks for your support Ryan!","createdAt":1436992190,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xNTk3NDQ3NjAz","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/931/682/491c045b1671c75c6efe2f27348a400b_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1461654102&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c9264637fd32e00a9f18960ea58249d9","name":"Karen Mahoney","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1597447603"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0xMDUxMDY5Ng==","body":"Karen,\nSaw your work at the Behind the Shoji exhibit, very nice!\n\nYou should consider adding backer levels to the project if possible. I think your platters or small vases are great and might add variety in the 50-100 area for people not looking for a plate or mug? Maybe some combinations like set-of-three bowls, platter & bowl, mug & plate, ... If there are other small things you can make for 20/25 having choice might catch some more people not looking to spend a lot.\n\nI'm really hoping this project can make it to funded, good luck!","createdAt":1436770094,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0yMjgyMjQ1MDA=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=38b545eeac1249d5d25c87db69d5ee12","name":"Ryan S","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/228224500"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}}]
