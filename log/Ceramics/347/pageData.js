Studio and living quarters are located on a 100 acre plantation in rural Virginia, far away from my home and life in Oregon. This Kickstarter project is to fund my residency so that I can focus 100% on my work while I am spending my time there. By selling some of the work I will make then now, I will ensure my ability to focus solely on what I am there to do- learn as much as I can about these kinds of kilns and their possibilities in the given amount of time.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Chrysanthemum Set, ^10 soda, 2013\" data-caption=\"Chrysanthemum Set, ^10 soda, 2013\" data-id=\"3945667\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Chrysanthemum Set, ^10 soda, 2013\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/945/667/8b527a4beb894b2f1c45797ddfe0fce1_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1433803766&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=41fa8ef6e3b8782394a4e3935e866dbe\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Chrysanthemum Set, ^10 soda, 2013</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;As I am leaving my life on the west coast behind for this residency, it is essential that I use this time to its fullest potential, and that means funding this project ahead of time so I can use 100% of my time there making work for and firing these kilns. If this Kickstarter doesn't get funded, I will need to get a non-clay job in Virginia during the time I am completing my residency to cover my basic expenses.&nbsp;This is an enormous chunk of time that will be far better spent in the studio making or at the kiln firing.&nbsp;The property is around 20 minutes outside of the small town, so it will be about 45 minutes a day just to commute to and from a job. With a part time job four days a week, this means 897 hours lost in the nine months between working and driving to and from a job. 897 hours lost! That's over 22 40-hr workweeks! I'm temporarily leaving Oregon to focus on this residency. Funding this Kickstarter project would allow that to happen, while getting a beautiful, meaningful, and rare piece of pottery of your own to enjoy. All work is priced no higher than my usual work, though these pieces are sure to be much more special.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Oribe Chrysanthemum Trays, ^6 electric, 2014\" data-caption=\"Oribe Chrysanthemum Trays, ^6 electric, 2014\" data-id=\"3945895\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Oribe Chrysanthemum Trays, ^6 electric, 2014\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/945/895/6bec774109e45a7935d0cd9565b46d79_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1433805863&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b8fb6e8c057b5c706b3ccd77733d7c43\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Oribe Chrysanthemum Trays, ^6 electric, 2014</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>About my work: \"<i>As a potter, my focus is on functional wares meant for everyday use, and my hope is that its users develop a close relationship with the pottery. By using surfaces and glazes that entice the eye for a closer look, and making forms, handles and curves that provide functional, tactile pleasure, the user is able to make a connection with the work through familiarity. This gained intimacy allows the user to make ordinary events a routine of small joy, memorable, and significant.\n\nI’ve always loved Asian art and its ability to bring a humble elegance and beauty to an everyday setting. Like pottery, it has a subtle serenity that asks the viewer to stop and breathe, contemplate the beauty, and enjoy the small delights. Whether it is the delicate petals of a drawn chrysanthemum or the soft shades of celadon glazes, there is a quiet but striking gracefulness to see. \n\nWhile there is this line of humility and significance shared between Asian art and pottery, the Asian influence stretches further into my work by borrowing techniques, forms, glazes, and imagery from Japan, China, and Korea. I am not interested in isolating these influences, but rather drawing out portions of them and reconstructing them with a modern perspective, style, and relevance.\"</i></p><p>The piece you receive will likely have some combination of rope impression and screen printing, two techniques I use extensively in my decoration. My screen printing is done with ceramic materials, not inks, and the imagery is both original drawings of mine and traditional Asian patterns.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Cloud Pattern Mug, ^6 electric, 2014\" data-caption=\"Cloud Pattern Mug, ^6 electric, 2014\" data-id=\"3945683\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Cloud Pattern Mug, ^6 electric, 2014\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/945/683/af2014978aea34ca0ab3aeff52b6e41a_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1433803932&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=cd01c09e0361a280f16bf3837d318056\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Cloud Pattern Mug, ^6 electric, 2014</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I've been a potter for about ten years, and have a major focus on functional work. During this time, the majority of my work has been fired in electric kilns. While these models are more than capable of producing beautiful work, the atmospheric effects offered by wood, gas, salt, and soda kilns are really where my interest lies, and I believe where my work will thrive. Having the time to focus only on building and studying&nbsp;these kilns&nbsp;so closely will give me essential hands on knowledge to prepare me for my own non-electric kilns in the near future.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"detail of Mount Fuji design on ^6 electric pitcher form, 2015\" data-caption=\"detail of Mount Fuji design on ^6
