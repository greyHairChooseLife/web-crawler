At the time, keeping up with making the ^6 electric work for my business wasn't allowing me much time to make work for the soda kiln. This tray is one of the soda pieces. The cobalt chrysanthemums are an original drawing of mine screen printed with a cobalt slip. The tray was left unglazed, letting the soda firing cover the piece with the glossy finish it gives instead. One of the kiln firings I will have access to during my residency is a wood soda. When I'll be working with these kilns then, my business is on hold. There's no ^6 work. But I've got to make money, so a part time job somewhere in town it is. Unless....If I can sell the work I will make *then* *now* through my Kickstarter, and get the project funded 100%, I can avoid that. I can gain an extra 900 hours of studio time. I can do what I'm leaving my life and business behind for. I can avoid having a minimum wage job take priority over making pots. I can focus on clay, the entire point of a residency. But only if my Kickstarter gets funded. Time is running out fast, and there's a long way to go. Please continue to help spread the word of my Kickstarter campaign. Every link share helps, please let your friends and family know about the project! </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1435275002,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEyNjU0NzY=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"A bit about wood firing....","publishedAt":1435275002,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Karen Mahoney","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/931/682/491c045b1671c75c6efe2f27348a400b_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461654102&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=b871df2472f9cd36afc5e824a1b617e8","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"body":"<p>Thank you everyone for your support! I am getting closer to my goal with your help!</p><p>Wood firing is quite a bit different than the electric kilns I've worked with during my time in clay. The unique process lends itself to beautiful, one of a kind results that can be very unpredictable. </p><p>My electric kiln gets filled with glazed work, I turn it on, carefully raise the temperature, and check periodically to see how the temperature inside is progressing. The firing usually takes about ten hours. I mix my glazes by hand using raw materials, and know almost exactly how the glaze will look after each firing. It is a very accurate and predictable way to make pottery.</p><p>The results of wood firing are like magic. Instead of being fired over a few hours, wood kilns are generally fired over a period of days. The kiln is watched constantly, carefully stoked with wood by a crew of potters, rotating shifts throughout the days and nights of the kiln firing. Inside, the flames twist and turn though the kiln, blushing pots with marks of the fire. The ash from burned wood heats, becomes molten, and becomes a natural glaze. This is why many pots go into a wood kiln unglazed surface, as well as why the firing results can be so unpredictable.</p><p>There can be multiple chambers of a wood kiln, each having it's own variation of materials introduced into the kiln during firing, the amount of ash built up, and final temperatures reached, among other things. Imagine the possibilities! </p><p>Clearly there is a lot to learn, study, and observe. This is why it is so important for me to get this Kickstarter project funded. Reaching the fundraising goal means almost an extra 900 hours of time for me to work on the reason I will be there: to learn about these kilns and what they can do. This time is irreplaceable. </p><p>All project backers will receive a piece of my pottery made during this time studying these kilns. It is a memento of the support that will be allowing me to have that irreplaceable time to learn and continue my path as a potter. </p><p>Please share the project with your friends and family! Word of mouth has been a great resource of project backers so far, let's keep our momentum! </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1433799765,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"9000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"2015.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":31,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
