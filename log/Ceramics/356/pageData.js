I got in to ceramics in college and became more and more involved as I learned to derail my academic plans in favor of doing something that I truly love. \r\n  \r\nI was the unofficial studio-tech at Central Arizona college for 5 years or so working with amazing artist/instructors and helping students with there own work. I also spent years working several ceramic related side jobs. \r\n  \r\nAt one of these side jobs I was mentored by Jim Calhoun, one of the best potters in the state of Arizona and probably the world. That experience cemented my skills as a potter.                                                      \r\n   \r\nLast year I made my triumphant but short lived return to C.A.C. as a fill in ceramic instructor over the summer. During this 5 month teaching gig I realized that I had much to offer in this kind of environment especially because of my unconventionally holistic and loose teaching style. The only problems were the lack of open studio time and small overcrowded kilns. The more serious students were always forced to limit themselves.\r\nWe were always thinking, \"if I could design and build a studio I'd do this and that.\" Well the time has come for a studio built by and for independent unestablished artists.\r\n \r\nWhat we really need is a comfortable and free environment where we  are limited only by imagination and can work all night if that's what it takes. This project is how I want to make that idea a reality.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1410116048,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":2,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://facebook.com","domain":"facebook.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/897/390/1465ca1a5d9ee253c6d114cd583257ac_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461548795&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1a5215debec3fda922ef5021c42098f4","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1236313564","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; !!!CALLING ALL ARTISTS AND ART LOVERS!!!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reaching the goal means being able to build a new outdoor brick kiln and outfit a super functional ceramics studio, a space for photographing high quality images of finished work, and a mini-gallery space. This free creative atmosphere is just the kind of place that will nurture creativity and allow us to work all night when inspiration calls.</p><p>This will also serve as a base of operations for the following-</p><p>1. community studio for some of those unestablished artists of the area. Of course I'll be producing beautiful handthrown dinnerware&nbsp; as well as sculptures and pots of all kinds. This is the where most interaction with the public happens.(craft fairs, workshops, etc.)</p><p>2. town beautification installations of public and or protest art.</p><p>3. workshop to help supply charities such as empty bowls, icecream bowls, maybe even potters for peace, etc.</p><p>4. Experimentation kiln for simple but miraculous ceramic water filtration pots and super efficient building materials. Yeah! </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the rough breakdown-</p><p>-Kiln - the kiln I want to build is going to cost around $10,000 and with gas lines, burners, shelves, and a tin roof covered area we will probably be at $15000- 18,000 with a finished usable kiln depending on what used materials I can find at the time. I will basically be building the biggest kiln possible for the $ while making sure other essentials are acquired.</p><p>Because of the above average size and height of the sculptures I want to create, no average kiln will do.&nbsp; This will be the nicest custom kiln around. When possible used tools and parts will be used to keep the kiln costs down while still building an exceptional piece of equipment. I am fortunate to have a team of friends including a welder/mechanic and experienced kiln builders to help me create a real dream kiln.</p><p>- as far as electric kilns for bisque firing, I have gathered some used fixer uppers that I will be repairing and or wiring in. This will save thousands of dollars. I also have tons of ceramic tools and ingredients to help this studio get off to a running start</p><p>-Wheels- I have a trusty old wheel but at 75lbs clay capacity I will need a more powerful wheel to pull off my largest creations. Extra $ or stretch goals will likely include one more smaller light duty wheel giving the potential for teaching 2-3 students at a time. = about $2,000</p><p>-Shelving-for drying and storage will either be built or bought depending on what I can find on craigs list or not at the time</p><p>-Photo booth- for taking high quality pictures of finished art to build portfolios and gain entry into juried shows, exhibitions, galleries, etc.</p><p>If everything above is taken care of and enough funding is left I'd really like to purchase a pug mill. This means that we can recycle our clay scrap and get the most out of it. It would also give the studio about a 1000lbs head start on materials with my scrap alone.&nbsp; A good slightly used pug mill will probably cost around $1500- $2000.</p><p>Stretch Goals. If we make it to 30,000 I'll buy a bigger used bisque kiln and donate my smaller ones to the local salvation army who expressed a desire to get a ceramics program going for the kiddies. We made pumpkins and little animals last year and had a hard time getting them fired.</p><p>Stretch- 33,000- at this number, I'll be able to put aside a fund for entering arts and crafts fairs, galleries, exhibitions, etc. This will ensure these costs get paid by deadline time, very important! I'll also make and donate an extra 50 bowls to help feed the hungry with the empty bowls or ice cream bowls charity events.</p><p>40,000- I'll get a hive of bees for the neighborhood and make honey sweetened moonshine for the backer party and I'll donate 100 extra bowls to feed the homeless with the empty bowls or icecream bowls charity event.</p><p>Stretch- 1,000,000- we'll get a highly visible shopin rustic downtown Apache Junction, give poor kids free lessons and pay the rent and utilities for the next ten years. I can dream. oh and 1,000 bowls to the empty bowls event!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">If you love art or the idea of an experimental art facility where artists pay only for there own supplies then we can't lose in my opinion. If this project is funded it will succeed because my goal isn't necessarily to make money but to create a space for artists to feel free to be creative and refine their skills without paying tuition or other fees. This is the best atmosphere to foster creativity. Anytime new art is created success will have been achieved and the world will be that much better off regardless of profit. And of course with that success and growing recognition we hope that the money flow like melting icecream or any other analogy not used by people who are familiar with a steady income.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":14,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 1</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 1</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>$1 get's you the feeling of doing something great for art,artists, and perhaps the world.
