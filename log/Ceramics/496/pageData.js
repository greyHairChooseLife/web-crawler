As an artist I'm very privileged to have been allowed to create a printmaking studio and a series of Japanese woodfired traditional (anagama) kilns at the University of Oxford's research woodlands at Wytham (see a video of it in its early stages here: https://youtu.be/JNIiMnY6uzI). &nbsp;The idea behind this project is to turn a small group of fantastically located but very dilapidated buildings into a community workshop/studio space for ceramics and printmaking. The whole thing is located in the same 1000 acre woodlands in which I have already set up and successfully run two separate projects: one in ceramics, the other in&nbsp;relief&nbsp;printmaking. &nbsp;As you read on, I will describe and add photographs of the Wytham Studio and the Oxford Anagama (Japanese) woodfired kilns - respectively the existing print and ceramics projects at Wytham Woods. &nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, both projects operate separately and&nbsp;have their own teams of volunteers, participants, contributors, beneficiaries, social media followers and supporters of one kind or another locally and from overseas. &nbsp;The problem is that neither project has an on-site covered space for teaching workshops, visiting residencies, exhibitions etc. &nbsp;A space has come up that would piggyback on a much larger, and well financed University initiative to create a fieldstudy centre in the heart of the Woods. It would be of immense value to our ever expanding stakeholder group to be able to have a non-commercially operated space to be able to throw pots, make linocuts, set letterpress type etc in Oxford, a city where property prices are so high and studio space so expensive and rare. I'm always being told these spaces don't exist. So I am taking this chance opportunity to try to create one. Please help in any way that you can.</p><p>THE PROCESS: As I said above, I intend to bring together the two pre-existing projects in a small combined arts and crafts centre by converting three small disused and semi-derelict buildings into onsite workshop and studio space connected to the existing kiln and printmaking projects. &nbsp;This proposal is in response to increasing demand for this kind of activity space, and pressure to expand our current facilities to include more undercover workspace for visiting groups. The concept is summarised below and then explained in more detail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Bringing together the arts and crafts components of two pre-existing community projects to increase studio workspace for visiting groups and artists, and linking crafts to the scientific research at the Woods.\" data-caption=\"Bringing together the arts and crafts components of two pre-existing community projects to increase studio workspace for visiting groups and artists, and linking crafts to the scientific research at the Woods.\" data-id=\"21953809\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Bringing together the arts and crafts components of two pre-existing community projects to increase studio workspace for visiting groups and artists, and linking crafts to the scientific research at the Woods.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/953/809/f8c7446f8703f5838f16a970f276f19a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1532018101&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=33442b6958a8aa8227b60e622fd96247\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Bringing together the arts and crafts components of two pre-existing community projects to increase studio workspace for visiting groups and artists, and linking crafts to the scientific research at the Woods.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>With the successful conversion and&nbsp;renovation&nbsp;of three semi-derelict buildings into useable workshop space, this project will extend the opportunities &nbsp;greater number of artists/craftspeople - in particular to the schools and local groups with which I already work (for example, this feedback from one local school: https://www.kingseducation.com/kings-life/2016/11/08/a-successful-art-residential-at-oxford-universitys-wytham-woods/). &nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Wytham is a short bike ride from the centre of Oxford, or alternatively we have ample free public parking for our visitors and volunteers\" data-caption=\"Wytham is a short bike ride from the centre of Oxford, or alternatively we have ample free public parking for our visitors and volunteers\" data-id=\"21961949\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Wytham is a short bike ride from the centre of Oxford, or alternatively we have ample free public parking for our visitors and volunteers\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/961/949/bbcc2b10bebfc382c8725b21a435326c_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1532080643&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=fe0c0b5f68aa5c6eea7427c6c96de340\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Wytham is a short bike ride from the centre of Oxford, or alternatively we have ample free public parking for our visitors and volunteers</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The picture below shows the three existing kilns at Wytham. &nbsp;While these offer potters and art classes a unique chance to fire their pots in a traditional manner rare outside of Japan, there is still nowhere to teach wheel-throwing or clay-building to the schools who visit and use the site. &nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The three anagama (Japanese) traditional woodfired kilns at Wytham Woods, which form the basis of the existing ceramics project, from which the new studios are an extension.\" data-caption=\"The three anagama (Japanese) traditional woodfired kilns at Wytham Woods, which form the basis of the existing ceramics project, from which the new studios are an extension.\" data-id=\"21942128\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The three anagama (Japanese) traditional woodfired kilns at Wytham Woods, which form the basis of the existing ceramics project, from which the new studios are an extension.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/942/128/c29e4d04f3dc5e0e49bcc2860cf3952c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1531935321&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=76af5b2ed541371da0b66165377205de\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">The three anagama (Japanese) traditional woodfired kilns at Wytham Woods, which form the basis of the existing ceramics project, from which the new studios are an extension.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The pre-existing projects - which include the Wytham Studio and the Oxford Anagama Kilns, have been entirely funded by piecemeal donations, private contributions, and the hard work of a large team of community volunteers (who continue to sit behind all the various aspects of this project). &nbsp;Small grants from time to time allow the project to expand.&nbsp;Your help now would allow us to build a series of small onsite studio-workshops onsite by renovating semi-derelict buildings for use by the community groups who participate in the projects. &nbsp;I have already obtained seed-funding of £2,675 to make a start on the first building (scroll down to see pictures of the site).</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The buildings I intend to use are known as 'Rondavels' a Westernized version of a southern African hut -

Local potters/printmakers get the opportunity to earn by teaching, and commercial firings help to pay for the outreach and events. &nbsp;</p><p>With occasional small grants, I buy occasional bolt-on extras that will help the project - such as kiln shelves, letterpress type, or pyrometers. Since building the Studio in 2011, the project has continued to generate a small surplus to running costs, allowing us to price its use correctly to maintain a high demand from traditionally hard to reach users, such as state sector schools and individual craftspeople attempting to make a living from their products. &nbsp;Without increasing our prices to users, which would naturally affect the least able to pay the most, we need to expand our workshop space.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"One of our volunteer potters teaching all-comers to throw pots on the Project wheel at a public open day event in May 2018.

The Woods get around 25,000 visits per year by the public. Much of the expansion of numbers in recent years is due to the public outreach done by the kilns and printmaking projects, in particular with school children. &nbsp;Wytham Woods is an ideal centre for artists to work, and for schools and students to come to us to learn and practice arts. &nbsp; It is fenced in, gated and safe, free to park, and close to Oxford. As a part of the University the Woodlands are home to a large number of research groups and activities, which under the current excellent Conservator are encouraging ever more people to enjoy stimulating and fun events in the woods.

The new kilns lie outside of the SSSI and our studio is a rebuild of a Victorian woodcutter's hut. &nbsp;If there is to be a new permanent arts/crafts space, then it has to use some form of pre-existing structure. &nbsp;The Rondavels seem an unlikely starting place, but on closer inspection they are in a better condition than the woodcutter's hut was when we were looking at creating the Wytham Studio.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A second look at the Rondavels: disused and dilapidated but when repaired, perfectly adequate and robust teaching space for small printmaking and ceramics workshops\" data-caption=\"A second look at the Rondavels: disused and dilapidated but when repaired, perfectly adequate and robust teaching space for small printmaking and ceramics workshops\" data-id=\"21941865\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A second look at the Rondavels: disused and dilapidated but when repaired, perfectly adequate and robust teaching space for small printmaking and ceramics workshops\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/941/865/271deeac3c43560341e51faedceaf940_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1531934002&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=bf221a296544b5f8c5c80d596fd1e59f\" data-airgap-id=\"37\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A second look at the Rondavels: disused and dilapidated but when repaired, perfectly adequate and robust teaching space for small printmaking and ceramics workshops</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>In the centre of the woods is a wonderfully gothic, dilapidated and cavernous Swiss chalet dating to the 1920s and to the former owners of the woodlands.

The Rondavels sit in the back garden of the new Chalet fieldstudy centre, and couldn't be better placed to share their facilities and infrastructure. This greatly makes up for the unprepossessing condition of the buildings we intend to use. &nbsp;What are our alternatives?&nbsp;Other than these disused huts, everything in the woods is quite rightly (and historically has been) designated for scientific research purposes of the University. We can't build anything new. &nbsp;Water and power are absent elsewhere in the SSSI. &nbsp;So the opportunity for alternative solutions is severely limited.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The main chalet building, which the University of Oxford is converting to a woodland fieldstudy centre.

With the help in kind from our local volunteers, who are kindly donating their skills and time, £12,000 (plus the £2675 already raised) would ensure that the workshop space was created to a standard adequate to prove the worthiness of the project and allow it to make an incremental step forward towards an ultimate goal of a long-term financial sustainable and well-used arts and crafts facility in the Woods. &nbsp;This model is exactly how Robin built the kilns and the studio we currently have. &nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Schools workshops in ceramics for 400 primary school children and 18 teachers at Wytham Woods in June 2018.

The Chalet redevelopment is set to go ahead in August of this year, and without having made a start on the arts and crafts project, the building are likely to be repurposed. &nbsp;</p><p>To that end, the initial sum of money already obtained allows us to make an immediate start. In the meantime, I need to raise the remaining £12,000 - or more if it is possible - towards the final £45,000 (which is really a long term aim that I expect will take around 3 years to achieve).&nbsp;If it would please you and you are able to, please help out. &nbsp;And if you would like to visit the site to see the kilns of the presses, then that is always easy to arrange, and the Woods are open daily from 10am until dusk most days.

challenge with this project is to work within the University of Oxford research woodland as an independent artist amongst powerful tenured academics from one of the World's top universities.   My past projects, of which this is an extension have been based on turning unwanted or disregarded space into space where craftspeople and artists can operate.  \r\n\r\nWithout salary, but relying on goodwill, grant-writing, volunteers, and income from art/craft sales I have put together a team which since 2010 has developed ceramics and printmaking programmes from nothing where previously none existed.  \r\n\r\nThe permission to go ahead with this project is based on my past performance and the continued utility and success of my projects in the eyes of the University Department that runs Wytham Woods.  The woodland hosts around 70 scientific research groups from Oxford University plus my arts/crafts research studio project.  Everyone has to get along, and even in a 1000 acre wood it takes delicacy and reciprocal understanding to make new projects work.  \r\n\r\nSo far, since 2010, we have been successful.  That said, in the preliminary stages of this work - building the kilns and the existing Wytham Studio - there have been very real challenges to overcome, particularly with large organisational funding partners who operate quite differently to community/collaborative venture based more on reciprocity and goodwill. \r\n\r\nHaving successfully negotiated these challenges, my team and I are exceptionally well-qualified to successfully complete this new workshop proposal, which perfectly draws together two strands of the successful crafts programme into a single physical location, which is central to the new scientific infrastructure in the woodlands. \r\n\r\nOur main issue is time: the larger science-led field-study centre is about to go ahead. The arts and crafts component has to move along with it in order to stake a claim in the time-limited offer of (currently) derelict buildings, or sadly the opportunity will evaporate. The old buildings will either be demolished as unsightly, or simply used in their decrepit state as extra overflow storage space for scientific research groups that will understandably expand to fit whatever space is available.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":3,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">£30</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 34</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nOriginal Linocut\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>An original limited edition black and white linocut made at Wytham Woods by Rosie Fairfax-Cholmeley of The Wytham Studio especially for this project.

We teach you linocut from start to finish, learning how to use the tools, rollers and presses, and how to turn simple sketches in fabulous works of art. We teach in groups of two or three at most so that you have all the teaching time you need to pick up the skills needed. On day one you learn how to make a single block print, and on the second day we will teach you the reduction method of making multiple colour layer linocuts. Lunch and all materials and equipment will be provided.</p>\n<span class=\"itemization-includes text-uppercase c-navy-light type-10 medium ls1px block\">Includes:</span>\n<ul class=\"type-14 ml3 green-dark mb2 pl2\">\n<li class=\"list-disc\">\nPrintmaking Course\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2018-10-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Oct 2018</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n1 backer\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (5 left of 6)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>"],"number_of_FAQ":"3","number_of_updates":"1","number_of_comments_depth_all":"0","contents_of_FAQ":["<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_255826\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"255826\" href=\"#project_faq_255826\" name=\"project_faq_255826\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nWho will be able to use the workshops?\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>We run a system based on reciprocity and charges for material costs.  Because this project is run by volunteers and enthusiasts, no-one is trying to make a large profit from it.

The aim is to encourage and foster the crafts in an affordable way for as many people as possible.  Each person who comes to us will have different expectations and requirements, and we try to find ways that would allow everyone to benefit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"type-12 navy-500 mb3\">\nLast updated: <time datetime=\"2018-07-20T05:27:01-04:00\" data-format=\"llll z\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Fri, July 20 2018 6:27 PM UTC +09:00</time>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>","<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_255827\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"255827\" href=\"#project_faq_255827\" name=\"project_faq_255827\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nCan I sell work made in the workshops\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>Of course.

The Wytham Studio is however a free standing concept, unattached to the University/Wytham Woods, who are in effect landlords to the Project.  This means that the new studio space is not a formal institution of the University, but rather is a free-standing workshop/studio space run by Robin and his team of volunteers, most of whom are volunteers taken from the local pottery and printmaking communities.  Naturally because we are in Oxford this team includes a high proportion of academics, but far from exclusively so. Our people are drawn from all over the world, all genders and ages. There really are no barriers to becoming a part of this project.  For detail or more information, just email Robin directly, who will try to answer your questions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"type-12 navy-500 mb3\">\nLast updated: <time datetime=\"2018-07-20T05:35:50-04:00\" data-format=\"llll z\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Fri, July 20 2018 6:35 PM UTC +09:00</time>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"],"last_updated":"July 23, 2018"}
