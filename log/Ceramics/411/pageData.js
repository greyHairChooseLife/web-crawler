When he was 12 years old he bought a jaw harp at a museum gift shop while on a family road trip tracing the path of the Oregon trail.  In 2005 he abandoned his dream of becoming a theatre major and took a ceramics class at Richland Community College.  Since then he has received two art degrees, made thousands of clay things, become an museum exhibits designer, and adopted two dogs and a cat.  \r\n\r\nKevin thinks that his art can help other people explore their own creative impulse and so he creates objects and events that people can use to make their own art, sounds, and stories.  Its a whole, big thing with lots of layers, but that’s not important right now.\r\n\r\nLike most artists Kevin can be a bit insecure, occasionally he is riddled with self-doubt, but mostly he thinks what he does is awesome. Kevin hopes you like his work, if you do you can see more of it at his website www.kevindeanramler.com.

Players who are eliminated are awarded a free xun, while players who persevere receive no reward. &nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Crates of Xuns\" data-caption=\"Crates of Xuns\" data-id=\"3101149\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Crates of Xuns\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/101/149/70a8d9432f4525e7b461031c7ba9f8fa_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1420301805&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2c2fc5c7cc34dde5837c070fd7e718ed\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Crates of Xuns</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Every NCECA attendee will be a player, or Vӕssel, in the game. At the beginning of the game a preselected group of assassins will be given a ceramic <i>Raygun</i> and deck of <i>Assassin Cards</i>. &nbsp;The assassin’s assignment is to approach any Vӕssel and “shoot” them with the <i>Raygun</i>. &nbsp;The assassin then gives the Vӕssel an <i>Assassin Card</i> declaring them eliminated. &nbsp;The Vӕssel may take this card to the Xun Zone Command Center where they can redeem it for a xun from the Chief Voulkonater. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A Rack of Rayguns\" data-caption=\"A Rack of Rayguns\" data-id=\"3101157\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A Rack of Rayguns\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/101/157/de8dd6a103ec92cea3ff1b8cc92e0549_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1420302029&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b232aaa0de79b7422d23e31ce2b9a5de\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A Rack of Rayguns</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The project will take place over four days of the conference, kicking off the evening of Tuesday, March 24th and coming to an end on the afternoon of Friday, March 27th. &nbsp;During the project Assassin's will be roaming the conference assassinating Vaessals. &nbsp; I will be in Xun Zone Command Center collecting statistics about the assassinated Vaessals, distributing xuns, explaining the game, and giving xun lessons. &nbsp;As the game proceeds I will be updating statistics on a projector screen and tracking the progress of the game.</p><a href=\"http://www.kevindeanramler.com/installations.html\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Light Emitting Cylinder- Pledge level $250\" data-caption=\"Light Emitting Cylinder- Pledge level $250\" data-id=\"3101154\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Light Emitting Cylinder- Pledge level $250\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/101/154/da793ed1e15f5c9dfd694c7ab626a19a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1420301937&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a5a13d4b45ed66a472d748f04159c64c\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Light Emitting Cylinder- Pledge level $250</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a>\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Some Background</span></p><p><i>A Very Serious Game</i> arose as an extension of <i>The Xun Project</i>. &nbsp;It was developed as a mechanism for distributing free xuns. The xun is a vessel flute, similar to an ocarina, it has become for me what a mug or bowl is for many potters. It is a small object that I can produce in large quantities and that allows for experimentation within the parameters of the form. </p><p>I have always been interested in systems. &nbsp;A system that might look simple, straightforward, and fair on paper is distorted by individual preferences, financial incentives, and personal networks when enacted in the real world. There is a disconnect between the systems we believe we are a part of and those that actually exist. In A Very Serious Game I have created a system that destroys my agency in the distribution of my work by using independently acting assassins to determine who receives a piece of art and who does not. &nbsp;The spirit of giving which is at the heart of this project is mediated by a symbolic act of violence mirroring the relationship between the maker and the market.</p><p>Of course this is only a game, and despite its title should not be taken too seriously. &nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the goal here is to give away musical instruments. &nbsp;These are objects, which unlike most functional ceramics, are used to produce, not consume. Unlike the cup or bowl, whose use is instinctive, the xun requires practice. &nbsp;It is an object with a life of its own. It grows in value with practiced use. It is an ancient instrument with a rich courtly tradition, capable of producing hauntingly beautiful music. &nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"bold\">How Can You Help?</span></p><p>I have already committed to bringing this project to Providence, eventually I would love to be able to take it to other venues and events. &nbsp;I really need your help to get to Providence,</p><p>There are three major costs associated with this project</p><p>$1700&nbsp;Travel and accommodations at the conference&nbsp;</p><p>$750&nbsp;Shipping work to the conference</p><p>$550&nbsp;Production and material cost&nbsp;</p><p>$3000&nbsp;Total&nbsp;</p><p>Of this $500 will be covered by a stipend from NCECA, which leaves the remaining $2500 that I am trying to raise</p><p>Your contribution will help cover the costs of the of bringing the project to life.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">About the Rewards</span></p><p>Most of the rewards (other than the T-shirts and postcards) are handmade by me, as such there is considerable variety in color, size, and appearance. &nbsp;After the performance in March I will return to my studio to make additional rewards, I expect to ship the rewards by the end of May 2015.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The risks for this project are major equipment failure or injury.  I currently have most of the reward items in inventory, and unless there is an overflowing of support or one reward proves particularly popular, I don't anticipate production delays.\r\n\r\nAs I said above, I have already committed to bringing this project forward.  As of the launch I have made about half of the xuns required for the project, my plane ticket is purchased and my hotel booked.  I will be in Providence in March.  I hope that you will help me get there and pick yourself up a sweet reward in the process.
