While we won't replicate the glaze done here to protect the collectability of the Kickstarter exclusive ones, we have started tossing around the idea of putting out a set of Mug Shots from Rummy Mummy and upcoming full size mugs in the future. What do you guys think? Is it something you would like to see? Chime in and let us know your thoughts!</p>\n<p>We still have plenty of mugs leftover so, if you know someone who would love to get their hands on a Rummy Mummy all of their own, please be a dear and bring this project to their attention: the karma alone should be well worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Lots of Love from John C.</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Rummy Mummy Mug Shots\" data-id=\"29919135\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/919/135/9725c360fce5db318b432d58238054f1_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1595485881&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f936f397def085302124fd8bf9d192c4\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Rummy Mummy Mug Shots</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1594756697,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI4OTA3MTk=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"A non-update update","publishedAt":1594756697,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Biggs Tiki","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/536/103/2f302d4bdf0bad14c14fc8dd4962b9a0_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1592609271&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1a860ab1c39829b11bfae59885977572","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"29819106\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/819/106/43ec204aa7b1fd7807621001cfa0d961_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1594756870&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=776a17a91c7e072b549998eee5c4428c\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p> Our little project keeps chugging along (thank you to everyone that backed us so far) and we really don't have much to communicate at the moment (except, maybe our gratitude) BUT, we thought you might like the opportunity to hear our art director talk about his creative process on Tiki Trail.</p>\n<p> If you're interested in hearing Mike's voice, be sure to dial in to Zoom meeting 724 724 4576 today at 6 PM PST for his live interview: we'll meet you there.</p>\n<p>John C.</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1594487960,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI4OTA3MTM=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"WOW!","publishedAt":1594487960,"pinnedAt":null,"number":1,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Biggs Tiki","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/536/103/2f302d4bdf0bad14c14fc8dd4962b9a0_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1592609271&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1a860ab1c39829b11bfae59885977572","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":6,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Holy Kahuna!</p>\n<p> Funded in minutes.
