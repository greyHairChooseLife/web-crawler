In 2007, I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in ceramics and painting.  I went on to achieve a double Masters of Fine Art from Radford University in ceramics and watercolor in 2010.  Since then I have been selling at a variety of art shows and festivals, as well as teaching classes and giving private lessons. </p><p>  I currently have work across Virginia- at the Green Heron in Radford, the Appalachian Fine Art Center in Richlands, the Peninsula Fine Arts Center in Newport News, the Wonderland Gallery in Roanoke, and the Jacksonville Center in Floyd. I also participate in a yearly sale/fundraiser for the Sawtooth School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.   My works are in private collections across the country, as well as in parts of Canada, Paris, and several other locations in Europe.</p><p>The style of work I have been developing over the years is very unique.&nbsp; To me the vessels I throw on the wheel are blank canvases.&nbsp; I study the resulting form to see what brush work would best accentuate it.&nbsp; I create the imagery on my ceramics free-hand by applying slip with a bamboo brush.&nbsp; My slip is the clay body blended down with water to a pancake batter consistency.&nbsp; I developed my style of brush work by studying Asian ink paintings.&nbsp; It is simply amazing to analyze ink paintings and to see how the artist uses a series of brushstrokes to form complex shapes.</p><p>You can check out more of my work on my Facebook account&nbsp; ^.^</p><h1 id=\"h:https-wwwfacebookcom\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Sidrak.Art\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/Sidrak.Art</a></span></h1><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"1233142\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/001/233/142/570a8dfc206185fd0f5cabb1823de76b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1382624461&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=69e38a5be49670d6f85341faffd82db2\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h:goals\" class=\"page-anchor\"><i><span class=\"bold\">Goals:</span></i></h1><p>My goal is to build an in-home studio so I can keep creating works of art that explore my Japanese heritage.&nbsp; I will be building work that incorporates my love of the natural world and all it has to offer, combining grace and beauty with timeless elegance. I also seek to be more competitive in my field, both by increasing the number of galleries that showcase my work, as well as by actively pursuing more exhibition opportunities across the country. </p><h1 id=\"h:how-you-can-help\" class=\"page-anchor\">\n<i><span class=\"bold\">How you can help: </span></i>\n</h1><p>I now have the space for an in-home studio, but I need your help to get things rolling. I need a kiln, a slab roller, additional bats, a large capacity air compressor, glazes, and most importantly, a throwing wheel.&nbsp; Creating a ceramic studio isn't cheap- tools and equipment are very costly.&nbsp; Ceramics are also expensive to ship due to their fragility, weight, and size.&nbsp; In addition, the firing process uses a lot of energy.&nbsp; Gas and electricity costs can stack up to a large bill quite quickly.&nbsp; </p><p>Currently I'm attempting to switch to cone 6 work since it is more cost-effective, and it will give me more freedom.&nbsp; Publicly accessible gas kilns that can fire up to cone 10 are hard to find.&nbsp; </p><p>I have been able to give back to my community for the last six years by donating bowls to either an Empty Bowl (Floyd VA.) or Beans &amp; Rice (Radford VA.) charity event. These two projects greatly aid the local community.&nbsp; Proceeds from those events go directly to helping feeding the youth in my hometown who might otherwise go hungry.&nbsp; With your help I can continue supporting these causes in the coming years. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"1233144\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/001/233/144/f6185bc5dfc2aa79674f962898b0ed86_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1382624525&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=91660f8cde4f1bca7f5b4dbb7de319ce\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h:what-your-contributi\" class=\"page-anchor\"><i><span class=\"bold\">What your contributions will finance:</span></i></h1><ul>\n<li>Electric Kiln and an electrician to install the 220v wiring </li>\n<li>Pottery Wheel </li>\n<li>Slab Roller </li>\n<li>Bats (a removable throwing surface) </li>\n<li>Glazes </li>\n<li>Paint </li>\n<li>Air Compressor </li>\n<li>Glaze Calculator </li>\n<li>Giffin Grip </li>\n<li>Brick kiln foundation </li>\n<li>Banning wheel</li>\n<li>Various other miscellaneous tools</li>\n<li>Exhibition application fees</li>\n</ul><h1 id=\"h:thank-you-3\" class=\"page-anchor\">\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank You &lt;3</h1><h1 id=\"h:sidra-kaluszka\" class=\"page-anchor\">\n<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ~Sidra Kaluszka</i>\n</h1><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"1233198\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/001/233/198/254a09b97b226fadebaba79eb3484c94_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1382625625&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7027db64d5dd85c1d7a16a5225118c9e\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Balancing my several jobs with quality studio time has been difficult this year.  Setting up a studio at home will eliminate the hour and a half drive to/from my former studio, and cut down on fuel expenses.  A home studio will also allow me the ability to work whenever I feel inspired.  Unfortunately the equipment necessary for a ceramic studio isn’t cheap, nor is it easy to move!  I have been, and will always be, a hard worker, but even hard workers need a boost every now and then.\r\n\r\nKickstarter is an all-or-nothing project funding source.
