I'm Cara, a college student currently studying to become an art teacher. I have a passion for just about anything art related, especially ceramics. I have about two years of experience and would love to expand my creations and output when it comes to wheel thrown pieces. I am constantly paying money to use a nearby studio's wheels and am limited in how much I create and when I can. I'm hoping that with the support of a Kickstarter, I can purchase a pottery wheel create some awesome, functional pieces to share with others!</p><p><span class=\"bold\">A few of my past pieces:</span></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"14442023\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/442/023/6ceac76529a68f358dd1485808a60dbc_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478642123&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1faded4805d8390c3c4e7924e779ce5a\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"14442049\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/442/049/897b9f67c3615ac1d33a89bad5b0b599_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478642255&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5eaa6dfe61f89a6cc8dcd9a2ee229996\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"A cactus ring holder.\" data-caption=\"A cactus ring holder.\" data-id=\"14442104\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A cactus ring holder.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/442/104/3e528b3d801063ebd5469bae2092b2ff_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1478642653&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6d5691c2ed1ca6b38baee1bd5b6c7930\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">A cactus ring holder.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\">How your contribution will help:</span></p><p>Once, and if, the goal is reached, I will used the raised money to purchase a pottery wheel.
