I've been making pottery for my community for four years now.</p><p>My hands are my most valuable tool when it comes to my practice. Ive always been able to depend on them but lately I worry they're beginning to let me down. </p><p>Ive spent the better part of the last few years creating thousands of pieces all while simultaneously reworking the mistakes or leftover clay back together by hand. Repetitive and strenuous activity with my hands during my practice and throughout my full-time job as a waitress have made simple tasks very hard. My hands shake sometimes when I am working or worse, swell. The circulation in my hands is barely working nowadays.</p><p> Recycling clay is a lot like kneading bread but the clay can be firmer and I easily recycle hundreds of pounds of clay at a time. Overall, throwing with recycled clay by hand can lead to poorly created pieces that suffer due to small bits of scraps, inconsistent drying times, and always become more difficult to manipulate on the pottery wheel or by hand. This piece of equipment is doing a service to my hands and the quality of my work.</p><p>Id like to actively start to take a more ergonomic approach to Glory Ceramics and invest in a tool for clay recycling. The Peter Pugger Pugmill that I've chosen is the right tool for my practice to grow and for my assured safety. </p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The challenges of this project are producing enough pottery for my backers without any pain.
