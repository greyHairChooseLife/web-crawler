You can place the dripper on top of your mug  to prepare coffee. You have to put a coffee filter inside of the dripper and add ground coffee, then add hot water and the coffee will drip directly to your mug! Sometimes a vacuum is created between the hole of the dripper and the filter. If that happens, pulling the filter a little to lift it, the vacuum breaks and the water flows without problem :)","createdAt":1578595428,"author":{"id":"VXNlci00MTQ3OTc3Mjc=","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/023/096/541/ce4d3325c091b2b6f254af3cc8b3873d_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=1541019919&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=2f3c0017721438bc5b77c45419b44554","name":"Marina Villa Pardinas","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/mancuernacafetera"}},{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0yNjg4ODQ2Mg==","body":"Thank you Maria.\n\nRegards,\n\n\nSteve","createdAt":1578599641,"author":{"id":"VXNlci0xMzE5NzI2Mjg4","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=38b545eeac1249d5d25c87db69d5ee12","name":"S.
