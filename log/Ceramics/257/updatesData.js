We have launched a website to help display our business and the pots that we are working hard to make! The website: www.joesinkpottery.com displays two lines of work, the wood fired and a white speckled line of pottery that serves folks who are looking for a modern, sleek alternative for their tableware! </p><p>A lot has happened since we fired the kiln for the first time and sent you all your kickstarter pots! </p><p>In October, I got married to the most wonderful woman in my life, Allie. Allie has helped me with the pottery business, the ins and outs of the book keeping, keeping me company sometimes in the studio, and is an expert clay weigher outer if I do say so myself!</p><p>We live in Durham, NC now (about 2 hours from where the kiln is built) and we still regularly cart all the pots to the kiln when we have a kiln load full! My dad has been helping out a lot with the wood preparation and firings, he knows plenty enough to take a shift and let me go get some rest during the firing. </p><p>Where are we making the pots? Well, glad you asked! I am renting a studio space at an art gallery in Creedmoor, NC called Cedar Creek Gallery. The gallery has an impressive collection of pottery from makers all over the United States. </p><p>As of December 20th, 2017 the pottery business is my full-time job! This was an exciting and big step for Allie and I to take, but we know we are taken care of and have the freedom to do what we love because we know that the Lord will provide for us! It has been an adventure in the almost two short months since we made this leap.</p><p>Make sure to check out our website and stay up to date through our instagram: @joesinkpottery</p><p>If you are in need of some new wood fired pots out of the fifth firing of the anagama to accompany the pieces you already have, then you are in luck! We have an online sale going live at 5PM EST at www.joesinkpottery.com</p><p>Thanks again to everyone who helped jumpstart my pottery career! Know that you all played such an important key role in this journey we are now on!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Joe Sink</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1482287445,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE3Njg5ODI=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Firing the New Kiln and Shipping your Pottery","publishedAt":1482287445,"pinnedAt":null,"number":6,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Joe Sink","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/933/659/10fe1e52266c36ab9b1e88240f8fdd6b_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1475262239&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=51073b162be1b13d4d1a2891ea775ff4","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":14,"commentsCount":1,"body":"<p>I want to first say hello to all the backers of the Anagama Wood Kiln Building Project! </p><p>I know it has been a very, very long time - over a month since you have last heard from me...but oh, what a month it has been! A lot has gone on since the last update...so hold on and enjoy the low down on the new kiln, the product, and new pictures below! </p><p>I have loaded and fired the kiln twice. I only updated you all on the loading process...because after the first firing I realized another was in order to be able to get you all great quality pottery before Christmas! </p><p>Two Firings of the kiln = busy, busy, busy! The first load of pottery was loaded into the kiln and the kiln was lit on Friday morning at 3AM by my dad, Travis. He is an early bird and was more excited than me to see the kiln get hot! So he started the kiln while I had some work to attend to, and that evening I relieved him of his shift and we fired till 10AM the next morning...about 30 hours! I did a poor job placing cone packs in the kiln, and due to a malfunctioning thermocouple I was mislead on the actual temperature throughout the kiln. The top of the kiln was over 2400 degrees but the bottom of the kiln was not nearly as hot, resulting is dry, tan, and dusty pottery....not what I was looking for. Not many pots were up to the quality that I desire...so this meant a second firing was needed. </p><p>I unloaded the kiln, restacking most of the pottery and adding more to the stack! I had big pitchers at the top of the kiln, mugs, bowls, and plates stacked throughout! I put six cone packs in various places...especially where I could see them from the side stoking port.(This ensured that I could see the temperature in the back). If you are wondering what a cone pack is, it is a chunk of clay that has 6 cones, made out of a material that melts at a very specific temperature, stuck down into it. when the cone melts, I know exactly how hot it is. </p><p>More firewood was required for the second firing. A day was spent stacking and splitting wood, and thanks to my dad and brother Wesley - the job got done! Woo! </p><p>The second firing was started on a Friday morning again at 10AM and reached cone 12 in the front at about noon on Saturday. We continued to fire the kiln to get the back up to temperature through sidestoking with long strips of oak and pine! We held the kiln at about 2400 for 5 or so hours. Once I felt like ample amount ash had melted on the pottery , baking soda was mixed with water and then sprayed into the kiln! I used about 10 lbs throughout! The baking soda helps give bright flashing effects and ensures that the pottery has a food safe coating on the ungalzed surfaces. I fired the kiln off for about another hour, then bricked up the openings and called it DONE! </p><p>I was well pleased as I cleaned up around the still glowing hot kiln, so very satisfied with the vast amounts of hard work that helped a dream of mine, one I might sa two years ago could not have been realistacally fathomed, come true. </p><p>Four days later the chimney damper was opened to let the kiln continue to cool. All in all t took about 5 days for the kiln to cool to a temperature that could be entered to unload the pottery! The unloading is a very personal time, and though friends and family want to be around for it all, I prefer that only a select few of folks be present. So many hours of work culminates with the moment you pick up the warm pottery with your gloved hands and no one but the maker experiences the intimacy with his craft but him. One piece after another emerged and most were splendid! I loved every bit of it! Lots of melted wood ash that blasted the pottery was melted, creating the shiny drips that a lot of you have coating your pots! </p><p>Once the kiln was unloaded, the pottery was organized, a cup of coffee was made for those present, and the work was again talked about, handled, and admired! I'm sure that I let out a big sigh as the anticipation and hope came to fruition!!</p><p>Throughout the next week the pottery was cleaned, rough spots were grinded off, and inspected to ensure that a quality pot arrived at your doorstep! It was a joy to get to experience and learn the process of making, firing, and shipping pottery! I learned that shipping over 100 orders is WAY more time consuming and expensive than I thought! phew...Im glad that part is over too. </p><p>Did I mention a favorite helper and friend of mine during this whole experience? Well, her name is Allie and she is my favorite person to have around the barn while I make pottery and around the warm kiln! She dedicated hours of her time to help me do the work that often goes unnoticed. You will see how darn good her handwriting is when you see your label on your box. The fact that you actually recieved what you ordered is attributed to her as well...because if I was the one shipping and organizing, well ou would probably be wondering why your mug looks so much like a bowl haha! So thank you Allie, you did great!</p><p>I have shipped almost all of the pottery the past couple of days and the last few bigger boxes, those of you who ordered pitchers and plate settings, jugs, and plates - your orders go out tomorrow! </p><p>Thank you all so so so much! Know that I could not have done it without your support! Let me know if there is anything I can do for any one of you! I hope I get to meet some of you one day and maybe even make you more NC pottery :)</p><p>I hope you all enjoy your new pottery and Merry Christmas! </p><p>Joe Sink</p><div class=\"template asset\"
