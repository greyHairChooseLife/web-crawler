I am used to traveling and making work that delves into old history and classic culture, putting it in a modern context. I want to show that the world is becoming smaller and use the power of art to bring us closer together intellectually, and emotionally as only monumental work exploring international context can. My project seeks to build international ties with spaces and studios in America with spaces in Europe through guldagergaard, which has accepted me as their resident artist. I will be there out of an interest in Scandinavian and Germanic culture while representing the American arts and my own personal desire to break the boundaries by making work that studies world culture. In ways such as art studying the history of the berlin wall, faith, hope, and vernacular history i plan on making functional abstractions of multicultural ideas and archaic stories Where\nelse but Europe can this happen? This project obviously needs a budget, and I have been working for the past year on solely my own income to make art doing\neverything I can for the sake of the work</p>\n\n<p>To really make this project, I will\nneed time. Two months time. And some breathing room. I will need materials, and\nkilns, and the ability to make a ceramics studio run. Now, I can run that with\nthe passion of the wind. I’m a trained potter and one of the things I know is\ntime and material management.</p>\n\n<p>What I will need is a little\nfunding. Not much, just enough to pay 2 months studio fees. Any extra expenses\nwill be paid by me, including food, travel, shipping, and any other unexpected\ncosts along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Normally an artist can get by on\ngrants this way. I work for many newer studios and while some get by on grants,\nothers are little more than a year old and I am their first artist to travel\ninternationally. This can make grant writing hard, but the reward for the\nstudios to have an artist finish an international residency is a big deal. Some\ngrants have been sent with fingers crossed, but they have their own interests\nin mind and the socialist in me doesn’t want to wholly cater to them. If I have\nto change my art at all (which I, like any self-respecting creator, will only\ndo if guided by pure intent!) I would rather cater to an audience. Let’s see\nwhat the public wants to see. The body of work is still technically in\ngestation, none of it will be made until I arrive in Skaelskor on the 1st\nof September. However, sketches are already available on my website at www.jeremysimsart.com where I keep a website with an RSS feed\ndocumenting my creative process, specifically talking about the little things I’ve\nfigured out as I go along this winding road of the fine artist, so that people\nin a similar place might find the answer sooner, and we can all get a little\ncloser to the golden ratio. This website, and any other platform I can get my\nhands on, will document the project and trip in its whole.</p>\n\nMy hope with this project is to take the first major step in my career as an artist. This is my first major chance to prove my legitimacy in my work, and I would love to have you to thank for believing in me.</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\"></p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xMTMwNjQyNTcz","number_of_FAQ":4,"number_of_updates":7,"number_of_comments_depth_all":1,"contents_of_FAQ":["<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_35362\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"35362\" href=\"#project_faq_35362\" name=\"project_faq_35362\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nWhat is Kickstarter?\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>(I've heard this a few times now)</p>\n\n<p>Kickstarter is a new funding program that sets for to either make-or-break funding for a project.</p>\n\n<p>If I do not make the goal by the deadline, no pledges for money are necessary.</p>\n\n<p>If I do make the goal, the pledges to be collected and deposited and I will be legally obligated to do what I promised with the money, and repay the funders in the way I promised.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"type-12 navy-500 mb3\">\nLast updated: <time datetime=\"2012-08-14T20:35:36-04:00\" data-format=\"llll z\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Wed, August 15 2012 9:35 AM UTC +09:00</time>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>","<li class=\"js-faq bg-white border mb2 shadow-button radius2px hover-bg-grey-200\" id=\"project_faq_35363\">\n<div>\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle block p3 no-outline flex items-center\" data-faq_id=\"35363\" href=\"#project_faq_35363\" name=\"project_faq_35363\">\n<span class=\"type-14 navy-700 medium\">\nHow will you repay us (the funders)?\n</span>\n<span class=\"navy-600 pl3 ml-auto\">\n<div class=\"js-arrow-icon\">\n<svg class=\"svg-icon__arrow-right svg-icon--sm fill-navy-600\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#arrow-right\"></use></svg>\n</div>\n</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-faq-answer hide pl3 pr9\">\n<div class=\"type-14 navy-700 normal\">\n<p>I am a professional production potter.
