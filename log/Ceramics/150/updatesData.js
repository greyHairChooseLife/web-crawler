I think that should do it.<br> Oh yes, and the recipe calls for 'hvidtøl' which is a low alcohol beer, but regular beer is fine too.<br>**Don't forget to save 300 grams of the dough for your starter (though I am sure you will be able to buy some if you do).</p><p>1st day (in the evening):</p><p>300 gr. Sourdough starter, 9 dl. warm water, 2 Tbs. Unrefined sea salt, 200 gr. Wheat flour, 375 gr. Rye flour,<br>375 cracked rye kernels. Mix, and let sit overnight covered by a cloth.</p><p>2nd day:<br>1 bottle beer, 2 Tbs. Honey, 200 gr. Cracked rye kernels, 300 gr. Linseed, 300 gr. Sunflower seeds.<br>Add the beer and let it seep slowly into the dough. Mix in the honey, add the remaining ingredients and mix. Cover with a cloth and let sit at least 5 hours.</p><p>Grease 2 one-liter bread pans, and divide the dough between the two pans. Let sit another three hours. REMEMBER: Put aside 300 gr. Sourdough to use as your next starter.</p><p>Bake the bread for one and one quarter hours at 200 degrees centigrade.  When the bread is out of the oven, wrap the loaves in damp clothes and let sit until the next morning.</p><p>I usually start my bread on Friday evening, then it is ready for Sunday morning.</p><p>The starter can sit up to three weeks in the refrigerator, and it can be frozen up to 6 months. </p><p>03-08-2005</p><p>German Beer Reduced Pork</p><p>What you need:</p><p>An oven or grill (GRILL)</p><p>A big mixing bowl</p><p>A six pack of good beer (A german doppelbock, or a Black Lager preferred)</p><p>An assortment of vegetables (try this with several different kinds, I use garlic, green bell peppers, one Serrano pepper (texas), an onion, mushrooms)</p><p>Seasoned salt</p><p>Paprika</p><p>Pepper</p><p>Bay Leaves</p><p>Olive Oil</p><p>Rosemary</p><p>Molasses (You can buy this at most grocery stores)</p><p>Mix equal parts water and beer (or just beer) into a large bowl. (The beer is VERY important here! Normally this would ONLY be a doppelbock for its high alchohol and sugar content, as well as a healthy mix of grains. I have substituted with Shiner Black Lager and it was fine, but do NOT use a cheap light beer and expect the same results. You would need to add more molasses and flavor were you to do this!!!)</p><p>Add your choice of minced garlic, peppers, onions, cauliflower or other meats/vegetables. Carrots work fine, leeks, beets (I love the color of beets)</p><p>(This is meant to mix with the marinade, so slicing it to a paste is preferred)</p><p>(Another method of applying the vegetables is to slice horizontally, and into the grain of the pork and stuff the vegetables into the meat after marinating)</p><p>Add paprika to taste (only a little)</p><p>Add two bay leaves</p><p>Add three pinches of rosemary</p><p>Add a spoonful of olive oil</p><p>Add a half cup of molasses and stir the mixture carefully. If the beer moves too much it will lose its carbonation and go flat.</p><p>Add a handful of seasoned salt carefully, and LAST.</p><p>Stir the mixture carefully and let the pork sit in the marinade for at least 5-6 hours</p><p>There are several ways to cook the pork, but you will need either an oven or a grill.</p><p>On the grill, you can take the pork out of the marinade and dry rub pepper grounds across the skin</p><p>You may also prepare the marinating vegetables by stuffing it into slices within the grain of the meat, but only if you minced them large. (I usually chop them into a paste)</p><p>Flour can also be added to the marinade and turned into a sauce by stirring it in a pan until it becomes thick</p><p>The marinade can also be kept and poured across the meat while it is grilling. This can make a big fire, but a healthy balance of pouring marinade lightly, and closing the lid of the grill will let the marinade drip into the flame and the pork will be smoked.</p><p>Grill to taste.</p><p>In the Oven, you can take a ceramic shot glass and fill it halfway with marinade. Cut a small hole in the center of the meat and put the shot glass under the pork, and set this in a baking bowl or crockpot with the rest of the marinade inside and a lid.</p><p>Because of the shotglass, we can’t put this into a hot atmosphere immediately. Heat it up gradually so the thermal shock does not cause the cup to break.</p><p>I cook based on impulse and have yet to try cooking the meat this way. Heat the oven to 300 and cook slowly, basting the marinade every so often.</p><p>During this, some extra marinade could be made into a sauce. I would recommend adding an extra flavor to make it taste different from the meat, such as a bleu cheese sour flavor, or boiling cloves and cinnamon into it, or adding tabasco or spicy peppers.</p><p>When the meat has been cooked, and a sauce has or has not been made (I wouldn’t waste that marinade when it’s done) I would typically serve the meat with pickled cabbage (this is traditionally a German dish)</p><p>While pickled cabbage, or sauerkraut are both hilarious excuses for a vegetable, the sour taste compliments the sweet, spicy and savory flavor of the meat. Mashed potatoes and peas would also work </p><p>Consider the colors of the food. Pickled cabbage is a deep purple and, if it was cooked right, the pork should have an orange, pink, golden color. Flour in the marinade would turn it into a rich earthy brown. This is the palette and the dish is a canvas.</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1352903743,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTM0ODg1MA==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"I need addresses :P","publishedAt":1352903742,"pinnedAt":null,"number":6,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Jeremy Hunter Sims","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/820/968/0b0b53c315edf6ef37fc8e3dd293f730_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461413755&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=e06e5e9563e15c45435a9c36e8b4cbb6","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1352673352,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTM0Njk2Nw==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Work is back, I'm back, of course it still can't run smoothly...","publishedAt":1352673351,"pinnedAt":null,"number":5,"actions":{"read":false,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Jeremy Hunter Sims","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/820/968/0b0b53c315edf6ef37fc8e3dd293f730_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461413755&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=e06e5e9563e15c45435a9c36e8b4cbb6","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":false,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":null,"nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1350858070,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTMzMzE1MA==","type":"FreeformPost","title":"HEY THIS IS STILL A PROJECT WOO!","publishedAt":1350858069,"pinnedAt":null,"number":4,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Jeremy Hunter Sims","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/006/820/968/0b0b53c315edf6ef37fc8e3dd293f730_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461413755&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=e06e5e9563e15c45435a9c36e8b4cbb6","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>HELLO!</p><p>Sorry for the long gap in updates, it has been busy here in Denmark!

And there are always more shows....</p><p>More importantly, I have set aside work for each of my backers, with my impression of what would fit them in mind.

But if you would like to cherrypick from the collection of work before it is shown, send me an e-mail and I will forward you some more photos.</p><p>I may be asked to show some of the work promised to my backers, and it will obviously be labeled NFS (with the name of the owner close!)</p><p>So, here's to a giant wall of important text!
