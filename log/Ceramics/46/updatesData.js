I'm grateful for it all.</p><p>Tomorrow I have to bring over 14 mugs to finish glazing as there's a gallon of my favorite glaze waiting at this sweet little studio to dip for a wonderful retail buyer for a phenomenal store in Newport Beach, CA.  I so look forward to the day very soon where I can mark off the \"not knowing how I'm going to create and fire\" goods on time and not have to transport the delicate wares wrapped in plastic, nestled in a nook in my trunk so not to dent, chip or break them en route.  exhale, the thought alone is brief relief... but for now, I will wake up early and haul a car full of bubble wrapped, paper cushioned partially glazed mugs to this empty studio to keep it some company.  I simply can't wait to have my chai tea and sit on the paint-covered concrete floor with a brush in hand.  </p><p>that's what dreams are made of...</p><p>Thank you everyone in my life who has contributed directly and indirectly to my growth and development and supported me in going for my heart's calling.  Thank you to every beautiful soul who has urged me to \"go for it and grow my love for clay\". Thank you to everyone who has inspired me in some way to believe in myself and my unique expression in this life.  May I share this and shine my love and light with others through this medium and in my unique way in this life... thank you my incredible contributors for giving of your energy in this form to support this... this beautiful dream of mine... </p><p>\"for the love of clay\"<br>in gratitude,</p><p>avesha</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1413414479,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEwMTIyNTY=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Staff Pick Selection!","publishedAt":1413414479,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Avesha Michael Ceramics","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/978/935/edea2ec8fd4936fb4ae875bf77a2869f_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461358622&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=642f250bda646a57141a59eedb0bac4e","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>We're so excited to have been selected by one amazing Staff Member as a STAFF PICK!</p><p>Thanks for stopping by... leave a comment, we love feedback and here's to going for your dreams and all things creative!</p><p>Bonus update:  only 65 minutes until we get the keys to our first ceramics studio in Culver City!</p><p>SO very EXCITING!!!!</p><p>THANKS grabillions for all your incredible support that got us this far... community if so powerful and so very beautiful... that's what we're trying to create so full force ahead :)</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Grabillion Thank you's....\" data-caption=\"Grabillion Thank you's....\" data-id=\"2747904\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Grabillion Thank you's....\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/747/904/779751bac96d17679f7887eb4352b042_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1413414452&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=ebb289b97d8eae968dba4dddc6f50a03\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Grabillion Thank you's....</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1412832747,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEwMTIyNTA=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Great First two days!
