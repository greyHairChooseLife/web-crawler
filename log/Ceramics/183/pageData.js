Whether it is the divisiveness of politics or the distraction of our screens blocking physical interaction, even the simple things that make us unique can leave us feeling that our differences create gaps that are almost impossible to close.</p>\n<p>I am creating the Bridge Mug series to serve as a physical reminder that we are not alone. We are connected in ways that do not have to be defined. We are on this planet together.</p>\n<p>As a ceramic artist, I am aware that every object I make is a gift of connection: between me and my practice, between the natural materials used in the making process, and within the offering of health and sustenance when used in our everyday lives. Every time something I have made passes from me to another I have created a bridge of connection. The concept of this Bridge Mug series is meant to extend these connections.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h:the-mug\" class=\"page-anchor\">The Mug<br>\n&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"2 pairs of prototypes, thrown and hand lettered.

Ready for the next step- the kiln.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Each of the 100 mugs in this series will be inscribed with 1/2 of one of 50 quotes that I have collected about all kinds of relationships: to our friends, community, and humanity. Your mug will anonymously connect you to the person with the other 1/2 of the quote, creating a personalized bridge. My intention is that each day as you use your mug, you can think about the stranger you never knew you could think about, and know that they are thinking about you. This bridge does not care about your name, age, gender, religion, politics, language, or location. It is made by the one thing that matters above all: that we are here, on this planet, together.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"each quote is created entirely by hand, from lettering to cutting out, and attaching to the mug.

I received my BFA in Ceramics from Maine College of Art. &nbsp;I have also managed community ceramic studios, taught in classroom settings as well as private lessons, sold my work in galleries, boutiques, at craft fairs and farmer's markets, online, and to all of my ever-supportive friends and family.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have been making, showing, and selling my work for over 15 years so I do not see any reason why I would not be able to deliver within the time frame I've created.
