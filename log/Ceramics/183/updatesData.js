Regardless, here we are. As the rest of the country seems to move forward and backwards these days, I have had to work against a few small setbacks and unexpected situations. This has caused me to need a little more time than I anticipated to complete this project. That said, things have been moving along and I am nearing the end. 2/3s of the mugs are currently in their 1st firing, with the remainder to follow before the end of the weekend, then glazing and final firings will happen next week. I am very hopeful that I can start to mail these out to you in a couple weeks. :) I‚Äôll post again as I get to these last stages.
