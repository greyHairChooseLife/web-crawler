They are truly pieces of art.  Pieces of art that I put in the dishwasher.   Scary to do at first but Norris says he does.   Lots of use and mine still look brand new. \n\nLove the idea of the smaller size.  I was going to get 1 set, but now I am thinking 2 per person so we can use them for dipping sauces.","createdAt":1562173684,"author":{"id":"VXNlci05MzYyOTc2Ng==","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=200&h=200&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=38b545eeac1249d5d25c87db69d5ee12","name":"drayindallas","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/93629766"},"replies":{"totalCount":0,"nodes":[]}}},{"node":{"id":"Q29tbWVudC0yNDY4MzkzOQ==","body":"Quick question. I've already backed at the 7 small plate level, however I'd actually like to either get a couple of additional small plates or another set of 7 I think (thinking about using some additional as gifts). Is there a good way to do that on Kickstarter page or is it better to do it after with the shipping surveys somehow?

If you a whole additional set, You can just add the $102 (doubling the price on the 7 set) and I'll refund you as I consolidate for shipping.  You can do the same for one or two more as well - just add the $19 per and I'll add them in and refund the shipping savings!
