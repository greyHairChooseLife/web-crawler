class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Please help me raise £700 to buy a pottery wheel, my university does not have access to a wheel, and paying to use one privately isn't cheap!&nbsp;</p><p>Being able to use a wheel regularly will really help me progress and develop the skills needed to make awesome pots, plates and bowls! I'm currently in my first year of studying Fine Art at Solent, and while working on my project I've become very passionate and interested in working with clay, particularly using a throwing wheel.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:heres-an-example-of\" class=\"page-anchor\">Here's an example of what I've made so far:</h1><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"This is my most recent bowl, it's drying and waiting to be fired.

I have realised that it is unlikely that I will be able to pursue throwing pottery for very long, as I have to pay other expenses such as living costs and other course materials.&nbsp;</p><p>If I do reach this target, I would like to keep the pottery wheel in our studios, where I will be happy for others to use it, if they would like to experiment with different making techniques.&nbsp;</p><p>Having access to a wheel whenever I need or want to practice will allow me to improve my skills rapidly, I would love to be able to create beautiful pottery and practice is the only way for me to achieve this. \n\nMaking pottery on a throwing wheel is a fantastic process. It's an incredibly therapeutic, even hypnotic way to make.&nbsp;</p><p>Your generous donations will help me, and others who use the studio, to gain access to an important resource, and therefore enable me to develop my art practice far beyond what could have been possible for anyone before.</p><h1 id=\"h:where-your-money-wil\" class=\"page-anchor\">Where your money will go:</h1><p>Your donations will all be put towards the single goal of buying a pottery wheel to help my art practice.The wheel will also be kept in the fine art studios so others can also have access to the equipment if they so wish.&nbsp;</p><p>If, thanks to all you lovely people, I hit my target of £700, I will put that money towards a wheel such as this one:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bathpotters.co.uk/shimpo-rk5tf-aspire-potter-039-s-throwing-wheel-with-foot-pedal/p6718\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bathpotters.co.uk/shimpo-rk5tf-aspire-potter-039-s-throwing-wheel-with-foot-pedal/p6718</a></p><p>My fundraising target is slightly higher than the cost of the wheel due to VAT, shipping costs for the wheel and rewards and for fees for payments and Kickstarter's deduction for hosting the fundraiser.</p><p>There are lots of pottery wheels available and the price varies dramatically, but for a mid-range, good quality wheel such as the one above the going rate is £600-800, delivery costs are also quite high due to the weight of the wheel.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"h:rewards-for-donation\" class=\"page-anchor\">Rewards for donations!</h1><p>As a away to say thank you for your support, I am offering some pretty sweet rewards if you donate, so you should check those out! They're on the right of this page, but here's a summary: Cake! Limited edition prints, drawings/photographs of whatever you desire and handmade and decorated bowls and mugs!</p><h1 id=\"h:keep-updated\" class=\"page-anchor\">Keep updated:</h1><p>I'm going to be putting regular updates of this campaign on my Facebook page, Needlepoint Punk: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NeedlepointPunk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/NeedlepointPunk</a>&nbsp;</p><p>It would be fantastic if you could help spread the word about this campaign through social media, or if you're old fashioned, you could actually speak to someone about it...\n\nIf you can't donate towards the project yourself, even talking about the fundraising to someone else will be a huge help!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I am not anticipating many obstacles once my fundraising has been completed, one concern is how much the delivery of the wheel will cost, as they are rather hefty bits of machinery. The wheel I would be purchasing weighs 12 kilos, and the delivery is estimated to cost £10, which I have factored into my total fundraising goal. \r\n\r\nThe only other worry I have is arranging for the delivery of the wheel to my university studio! The studio is on the second floor of the building, but luckily there is a deliveries lift I can negotiate the usage of.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0xODQxOTM5OTUz","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":12,"number_of_comments_depth_all":3,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nThank you for helping to raise £732 to buy a pottery wheel!\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/363/987/14f59d9fd67093af066964c87dba8c41_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1463756994&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=ddded1a60340b17fa5445bf8cd5babe0","last_updated":"July 21, 2016","project_name":"uy a Pottery Whee","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"£","amount_of_goal":"700","amount_of_pledged":"731","number_of_backers":"20","rate_of_funded":104,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Southampton, UK","creator_name":"Emily Brown","creator_location":"Southampton, UK","creator_description":"Emily is a co-founder of Braincrack Games Ltd, amateur potter and works with Deeper Dorset on the Finding Meyer’s Herc project.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Emily Brown","creator_last_login":1630055507,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":14,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":2,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.deeperdorset.co.uk/","domain":"deeperdorset.co.uk"},{"url":"https://www.braincrackgames.com","domain":"braincrackgames.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/010/765/441/70845fa4ab355161f0caba5dc6942f8f_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1548093951&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=bc6b366433d9fb7cd9a2e0976a6acbc3","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1272575248","top_cities_location_1st":"Portsmouth United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"3","top_cities_location_2st":"Fleet United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"2","top_cities_location_3st":"Ashfield United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_cities_location_4st":"Bristol United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"1","top_cities_location_5st":"Eastleigh United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"1","top_cities_location_6st":"Farnborough United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"1","top_cities_location_7st":"Honiton United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"1","top_cities_location_8st":"Louth United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"1","top_cities_location_9st":"Spalding United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"1","top_cities_location_10st":"Stoke-on-Trent United Kingdom","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"1","top_countries_location_1st":"United Kingdom","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"17","top_countries_location_2st":"Belgium","top_countries_number_of_backers_2st":"1","top_countries_location_3st":"Singapore","top_countries_number_of_backers_3st":"1","top_countries_location_4st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_4st":"1","number_of_new_backers":13,"number_of_returning_backers":7}
