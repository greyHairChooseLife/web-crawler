The price was right because artists &amp; other businesses are being encouraged to develop the district. Affordable rent enables us to manage the risks involved; sharing shop duties with two other partners gives me time to work in my pottery studio to produce my work.\r\n\r\nSales of my pottery have progressively increased every year; my work is drawing lots of positive feedback and galleries throughout the region are placing orders. The past two years have been the best years for my art sales since the economic recession of 2008.\r\n \r\nThe kiln breakdown was an unexpected challenge that has caused unforeseen production delays. My credit is extended because of expenses in setting up the gallery. Without a kiln, I cannot create new pieces, and I cannot go forward with the gallery. \r\n\r\nThere is a small kiln at the gallery, capable of handling three of my pieces at a time, but it is not hooked up to 220v power; we need to hire an electrician. This kiln represents a future backup capability for my production requirements.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0zMDI3NjAwNzU=","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":3,"number_of_comments_depth_all":4,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nMy own gallery is my lifelong dream; I invested everything penny I have.
