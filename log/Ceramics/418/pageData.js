Giving context and cultural information through the forms, techniques and ornamentation. SEED welcomes all members of the community &amp; prides itself on being a safe and accessible space.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Founded in 2021, SEED was created by artist SiouxBean.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a fully assimilated person of color, Siouxbean gains access to the knowledge of his various cultures&nbsp;through the mediums of clay and food. With 20 years of experience in&nbsp;Ceramics and a BFA from California College of the Arts. &nbsp;SiouxBean&nbsp;Understands&nbsp;the difficulties associated with access to quality facilities&nbsp;that safely support.&nbsp;SEED is&nbsp;a space where all cultures,&nbsp;Black, Indigenous and People Of Color can feel safe to explore the medium of clay craft, as well as their own history&nbsp;and the roots&nbsp;of others.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We are currently expanding our curriculum and means of educating our community on the different cultural aspects of ceramic art. We are hoping to build a solid intersectional curriculum that encompasses multiple cultures by working with ceramic artists and educators of multiple cultural backgrounds. Once we build out curriculum, we intend to offer it to the general public through classes, workshops, and professional developments. We are currently in the process of building our studio to be able to welcome both the ceramic artists and educators that we will be working with, but potential students as well. While our first priority is the BIPOC population in Sacramento, specifically the youth, &nbsp;once our curriculum is created we intend to share it and the process of creating SEED and our curriculum at the 56th Conference of the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts, a.k.a. NCECA 2022.</p>\n<br>\n<p>This Kickstarter will help us to purchase new equipment and supplies necessary to run the studio, allow us to build a curriculum, purchase or create the materials needed to implement it, and to help us prepare for our presentations at and during NCECA 2022. The funding from this Kickstarter will help to bring a POC created ceramics program created by ceramic artists and educators to a nationwide audience. This Kickstarter will help fund a project that will change the way that ceramics education will progress in the future.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Funding this Kickstarter isn't only for this single conference. It will help to build SEED as an organization that will create future ceramic artists and educators centered in intersectional teaching and curriculum practices. It is our hope that SEED will be able to branch out from being a local resource to being an online presence as well.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">While we aim to have all appointments scheduled by March, conflicts may occur and we may need to book further into the year.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":8,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSeed Studio Sticker Pack\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Get a pack of assorted stickers created by Seed staff.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2022-02-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Feb 2022</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n2 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 25</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 25</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSeed Shot Glass\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Get your own unique Seed ceramic shot glass designed and created by Seed staff members.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2022-02-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Feb 2022</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (30 left of 30)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nSeed Tumbler\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Get your own Seed tumbler designed and created by Seed staff.
