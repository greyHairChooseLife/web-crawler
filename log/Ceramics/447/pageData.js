I pride myself on having a fantastic sense of humor (even if sometimes my sense of humor is rather raunchy & vulgar).  \r\n\r\nI homeschool our daughters (twins are eight years old, a four and a half year old and a 16 month old).  Science & art are their favorite subjects.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed being in the workforce until two years ago. Child care become an issue once we removed our twins from public school & found out that day cares here refuse to accept home schooled children. While their education is worth this sacrifice, living on one income is stressful and I desire to do something to help.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Nastashia Dawn Frick","creator_last_login":1430349555,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.etsy.com/shop/frickinhookin","domain":"etsy.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/361/486/28ee5f0cdffd50f5d1ca56593ada3fb6_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461585460&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=2e794b44256ded53b88dadc8439bad99","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1871505945","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Hello everyone! &nbsp; I currently do some crochet work &amp; hand paint store purchased ceramics here and there to help pay our bills but my dream is to own a kiln and make custom (and useful) pottery.</p><p>I want to expand from hand painting ceramic mugs with fandom related images, amusing wording &amp; so on to actually making the ceramics. &nbsp; I would love to be able to get a kiln &amp; make the mugs myself (along with other awesome ceramics).</p><p>My husband works his butt off while I stay at home with our four girls &amp; homeschool them. &nbsp; I want to be able to lessen the financial strain while providing awesome, one of a kind artwork that can be shared with the world.&nbsp;</p><p>As a crocheter &nbsp;(we call ourselves hookers haha), I have seen so many amazing images of ceramic yarn bowls. &nbsp;I have so many ideas of different types to make! &nbsp;I'm filling a notebook with ideas of things to make (not just yarn bowls of course). &nbsp; There are no local pottery places within hours of me.&nbsp;</p><p>If I could achieve this goal &amp; sell my wares (I have already had several crocheters wanting yarn bowls and several people wanting custom coffee mugs), it could immensely lighten the stress of barely scraping by on one income with no assistance.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The biggest obstacle I can forsee would be getting my products out there for all to see.  I am very lucky to be part of a couple awesome groups of ladies on Facebook that would help me network my products.   Many of those ladies have already expressed interest in the custom painted mugs.\r\n\r\nNetworking is incredibly important.  I would also love to attend craft fairs with my finished products to help get my name out there.  As well as other online markets. \r\n\r\nI foresee that being my biggest obstacle.
