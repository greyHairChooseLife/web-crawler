I am now, finally in the position to house a kiln! All of my pieces are designed, hand drawn, hand painted, hand glazed and loaded into the kiln by me. I have painted hundreds and hundreds of pieces over the years with my two hands and I have loved every minute I've spent creating them, but without my kiln of my own, I will no longer be able to do what I love.

Terrified she was thrown into a whirlwind of tests and toxins. It all culminated in a seven-hour surgery that left her unable to speak or walk for days. \r\nShe still recalls in vivid detail the struggle to regain her art, to learn to draw again. “It was like drawing in reverse. I needed to find my lines again”, she explains. “To rediscover my boldness, my strength. Each line needed to be re-imagined, made whole again.”\r\nToday, years later, she is whole. Married with two healthy boys she is cancer free and the lines on her pieces are both bold and clear. Each one a reflection of the treasures she hunted for as a child on the bucolic North Shore of Long Island in those years before the storm, life affirming memories of her strength. The tree limbs, the blades of grass, the lonesomeness of dead ocean life, even the breath of the waves.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1598048359,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":1,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":2,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://www.jessicahowardceramics.com/","domain":"jessicahowardceramics.com"},{"url":"https://www.etsy.com/shop/jessicahoward","domain":"etsy.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/007/336/787/00f7a2ca33c9729d4f95d51eaa6b0205_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461451093&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=f0bed8b65585d55cc15f488dc30f6dbb","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/349952367","top_cities_location_1st":"New York United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_1st":"7","top_cities_location_2st":"Huntington Station United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_2st":"5","top_cities_location_3st":"Bronx United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_3st":"5","top_cities_location_4st":"Brooklyn United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_4st":"5","top_cities_location_5st":"Huntington United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_5st":"4","top_cities_location_6st":"Northborough United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_6st":"3","top_cities_location_7st":"Carmel United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_7st":"2","top_cities_location_8st":"Cold Spring Harbor United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_8st":"2","top_cities_location_9st":"Hempstead United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_9st":"2","top_cities_location_10st":"Philadelphia United States","top_cities_number_of_backers_10st":"2","top_countries_location_1st":"United States","top_countries_number_of_backers_1st":"75","number_of_new_backers":55,"number_of_returning_backers":22}
