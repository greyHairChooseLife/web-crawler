As one would expect, throwing wheels and kilns are not cheap investments. Therefore in this project any one who donates $25 or more to the cause will receive a hand thrown mug made and signed by me. I have yet to come up with a design for these mugs but I figure I can figure that out once I get the equipment I need to build my ceramics career. Make sure that you comment or let me know if you backed $25 or over so I know who to send mugs to.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Obviously $2,500 is a steep investment to get me back on track. There shouldn't be a whole lot of risk on this project because I have given myself plenty of time to fulfill the rewards for donating to the cause. I can make mugs fairly quickly given that I have the proper equipment.
