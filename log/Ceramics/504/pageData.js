I have been in this city for a bit over 13 years, and made time for clay every step of the way. I received my BFA in Crafts concentration in Ceramics from UARTS in 2011. I've worked at The Clay Studio and other community clay studios over the years as well as dabbled in home studios. In addition to clay work I also make large scale Installations. I gravitate to processes of layering and collage,  along with ideas of memories, how we store them and how they are retrieved or triggered.  MVP STUDIO is my clay business where I make work for the home. I focus on Nerikomi a traditional Japanese technique of layering different clay bodies to create an agate surface. \r\n\r\nMore of my work can be seen on Instagram @mvpstudio.me","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Mackenzie Pikaart","creator_last_login":1666550249,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":2,"creator_number_of_backed_project":14,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.mvpstudio.me/","domain":"mvpstudio.me"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/758/052/d4952a45c72adb8f9611ee94e8b8fe9a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1511580949&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=1432f50404344dc9ae5b62023f5c3e54","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/2000183080","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>200 Bowls is a project to explore process through clay. I have been working on a ceramic technique called underglaze transfers in which I paint a pattern and then slip on the plaster mold, then cast a form. Once the form is ready to be removed from the mold, the images/designs painted on the mold transfer to the cast form. With each form made more information will be learned about the forms, what they can handle (as far as layering and carving) , and how many layers is the right amount. I love working in this process and it has been super fun to explore! I hope you can help me on this journey and gain one of my treasures in return.&nbsp;</p><p>If this project is fully funded, it would&nbsp; help me fund my ceramic studio with the materials needed to make all these unique bowls just for you!!! The items needed are 10 plaster molds (to make more than 4 pieces every 2 days), casting slip, carving tools, underglaze, and all glazes needed to complete all the bowls. I will be able to focus on creating 200 unique patterns, so that all of these bowls can be limited additions of one!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;*If you are a backer that has a set, please know that the bowls will be similar to each other but not exactly the same, but they will all be fantastic!!</p><p>Please help me make this a success!!!&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The challenges for this project will be temperature and moisture here in Philadelphia. If it rains a ton or consistently, then while the pieces in the molds are drying they will take longer to set, which will push back time of completion. If it is really dry, then I will be able to make multiples, but i will have to watch how dry the pieces get before doing finishing trimmings.  \r\nOther challenges include the time restraint that I have put on myself. I work full time and then on other artwork, so all of these pieces will be produced in my limited spare time. I am definitely up for the challenge, but it will be a tough one.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":7,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nThank you Email\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Thank you for your support, and you will be added to my email list where you will receive email updates on my work, and invites to events and shows.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2018-02-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Feb 2018</time></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nThank you Postcard Print\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Thank you for your support!!! \n<br>With this reward you will receive a handmade postcard print.
