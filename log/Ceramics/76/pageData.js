Each bunny is individually handmade from ceramic clay, signed by the artist (me!) and then bisque fired in a ceramic kiln. After over 24 hours in a kiln or and cool time, each one is inspected then glazed before being kiln fired once again. Some rabbits are glazed and fired in a raku kiln, others are fired to cone 6 or cone 9 depending on glaze colors. Inside each is my artist signature. These bunnies are about 3 inches long and 2 inches high,&nbsp;perfect size for a gift basket or for peeking out from a leafy potted plant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These rabbits can be kept indoors or outdoors. Since they are ceramic, they are safe to keep in a potted plant or can be used in your Spring or Easter Decorations, (you may want to bring in before a hard freeze if you choose to keep them outside.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rabbits show up again and again in many cultures and myths. A sign of prosperity, fertility, renewal and good luck, rabbits are a favorite animal worldwide. Each has it's own little personality, and I hope you enjoy these baby bunnies as much as I did creating them.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">Timelines can be affected by firing schedules and kiln maintenance, typically tho, there are few problems with meeting timelines.
