I am a designer and an artist in Wichita, Kansas. Currently, I paint at home, but now I need to turn my garage in to a pottery studio. I am transitioning from making art part time to full time. I intend to produce enough pottery in my studio to start a business.</p><p>I have thrown pottery since my freshman year in high school, and I graduated with a bachelors of fine arts in 2008, and a masters in fine arts in 2014. Throwing pottery is something a crave and I feel driven to do.</p><p>With my husbands help, I am building my studio ASAP. I have a special opportunity with support from some friends to transform my garage in to a working art studio.</p><p>We need to break up and relay the concrete floor, install doors with windows for light and inspiration, and install a sink.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a local ceramics supply store that I will be able to fire pieces in and do not need to purchase a kiln just yet.</p><p>The largest purchase I need to make is the potters wheel, which is $800, and i have $400 set aside for that, already. I need to purchase sliding glass doors, which we will find used, approximately $170. The concrete floor purchase is approximately $130 and we will do the labor ourselves. My husband and I are very resourceful and up-cycle whenever possible.</p><p>I believe art is important because it reminds us of how powerful and unique human beings are. Especially with ceramics, people can enjoy a one-of-kind piece made in an ancient art form. People seek out what is unique, rare, and beautiful. I want to provide beauty and functionality to everyone!</p><p>Thank you so much!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I think the setback would be finding galleries or shops to host/sell my items. Investing in the studio will only be positive--it is a set space for creating art, and this can only get better from here. The hardest (and newest) part for me will be to sell my work and my brand. This is something that will be fairly new to me. I have completed courses in my masters program to prepare me for this, but I have yet to actually have the opportunity to do this. I believe it will feel slow, at first, but the longer I perfect my product, the easier it will become.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":3,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 10</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 10</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>If you pledge $10 or less, I will make you 10 no-bake cookies and send them to you immediately.
