First of all, I want to thank you for coming here to check out my Kickstarter to raise funds for my kiln.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have recently moved into a new house which has the space for me to set-up a studio in the garage, which is a dream come true for me. I used to create and fire my work at Cardiff Pottery Workshops, but I have now moved too far away for this to be an option. I have some money saved to put towards getting the space fire-proofed and to purchase a kiln, however, I still need to raise between £500 and £1000 to go towards the purchase of the kiln. &nbsp;If I manage to raise £500 this will go towards getting me a small top loader and if I can raise over £1000 this will go towards getting me a slightly larger top loader.</p>\n<p>This is where you can help, I am offering a wide range of rewards for donations, so you can help me to purchase a kiln, as well as getting your hands on a piece of my work. &nbsp;Clay is my passion, my life, my love. It is my dream to be able to create my work full-time and it is becoming more and more possible.

I would spend my childhood playing in there and making little fairy houses for the fairies (gnats ha ha) by the stream. I was surrounded by so much creativity growing up, my Mum is also always so inspiring&nbsp;to me, she has always dabbled in different techniques and materials, creating pieces with such fine details. My Dad was also very talented and I have fond memories of drawing with him when I was little. Creativity is in my blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Example of Mushroom Fields design on a large 22oz mug\" data-caption=\"Example of Mushroom Fields design on a large 22oz mug\" data-id=\"25439207\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Example of Mushroom Fields design on a large 22oz mug\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/439/207/0bba1fa49b2d3a5790017306c09c1b28_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1560187555&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4cd1f43f057fed47aa057e42d8d8f1d8\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Example of Mushroom Fields design on a large 22oz mug</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><br>\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Cardiff Met Uni where I graduated with a BA (hons) in Ceramics in 2016. When I set-up Cotton and Clay Design in 2018, it was a way for me to heal after a traumatic experience. I started creating for &nbsp;love, making things that I wanted to make and things that I wanted for myself. Realising that my work resonated with so many people, I started to create larger bodies of work, expanding my range and creating pieces that I only dreamed of. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Collaboration with Morgin Riley -Her custom 4oz espresso mug with Forest Eye design.\" data-caption=\"Collaboration with Morgin Riley -Her custom 4oz espresso mug with Forest Eye design.\" data-id=\"25439083\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Collaboration with Morgin Riley -Her custom 4oz espresso mug with Forest Eye design.\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/439/083/9b0efec4b130a930a239b6bed00103dc_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1560186821&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a53fdb8eee072146e36614082d762b32\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Collaboration with Morgin Riley -Her custom 4oz espresso mug with Forest Eye design.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>1 year later, I am making connections with people, collaborating with some of my favourite artists and sending my work around the world, further than I have ever been.

Every piece starts as a ball of clay, I then use a pinch pot technique to form the base of the shape and then, for larger pieces, I add coils to build it up. I use cobalt oxide to either hand-paint my designs on or I use it as an oxide wash to pick out texture on other pieces. Each piece is high fired to 1280 degrees c. and sanded with extra fine sandpaper to create a very smooth and tactile surface. My mugs are glazed with a clear glaze on the inside and left raw on the outside, exposing the pure beauty of the porcelain. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am inspired by a number of things in this world but, nature, astrology and symbolism are my true passions. I adorn each piece with these meaningful and powerful symbols, reflecting my pure love and fascination for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Examples of designs on mini dishes \" data-caption=\"Examples of designs on mini dishes \" data-id=\"25439229\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Examples of designs on mini dishes \" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/439/229/3a313ba68d51f9812f819495a4010cd2_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1560187674&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=6d6d9a0513f3f30aaceb99e3b9010286\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Examples of designs on mini dishes </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Example of large full moon wall-hanging \" data-caption=\"Example of large full moon wall-hanging \" data-id=\"25568090\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Example of large full moon wall-hanging \" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/568/090/324744d0e6bd2b2a4719902a045a2d6c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1561115391&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=cc674fd694ed3d806c4e63d87c1ed3c9\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Example of large full moon wall-hanging </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><br>\n <span class=\"bold\">How long will it take to receive your piece?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><br>\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will need get the fire board fitted and purchase a kiln, which I am hoping won't take longer than a month. I can purchase some porcelain before the end of the campaign so that I can make a start on creating your rewards. Please be aware that I will also be creating these alongside creating my main work so it could take up to 5-6 months before you receive your piece, depending on how many pledges I get. This is because I am only able to make and fire a certain amount of pieces a month. However I will be making a list and working through them as quickly as possible, pledges will be my main priority and I am aiming to tick off 20 pieces a month. These will be done in the order that the pledges come in. All pledges will also have the option of first dibs on updates as well.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Example of Large 24oz Hand-sculpted bracket fungus mug\" data-caption=\"Example of Large 24oz Hand-sculpted bracket fungus mug\" data-id=\"25439242\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Example of Large 24oz Hand-sculpted bracket fungus mug\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/439/242/577a80d16f90e92f29f45cce829f3bee_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1560187756&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5d63d8d7cb2439f9d085976845cccaad\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Example of Large 24oz Hand-sculpted bracket fungus mug</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I want to thank you all for your love and support in helping me make my dreams come true.

I have already costed up the fireproofing and installation of the kiln, and have someone in place ready to do the work for me.\nI was concerned about the timescale for fulfilling the rewards, as items do sometimes break in the kiln.  I have set the delivery times for the rewards at 6 months to take this into account, and I also make multiple pieces of the same design.  This should ensure that I can guarantee that I will have them made.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","commentable_id":"UHJvamVjdC0yNzQ0MjMwOTA=","number_of_FAQ":0,"number_of_updates":3,"number_of_comments_depth_all":6,"contents_of_FAQ":[],"project_description":"\nHelp me to purchase a kiln so that I can continue to build my small business,\n","project_imageURL":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/573/556/94129fe1d4dcca78d4d04571ba0aae90_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&crop=faces&w=1552&h=873&fit=crop&v=1561152605&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=a7067756618095cd422a2c55a19d135a","last_updated":"September 11, 2019","project_name":"otton and Clay Designs Kiln Fund Raisin","currency_type":"US","currency_symbol":"£","amount_of_goal":"500","amount_of_pledged":"1,420","number_of_backers":"30","rate_of_funded":284,"project_we_love":false,"category":"Ceramics","location":"Wales, UK","creator_name":"Beth Gregory","creator_location":"Caerphilly, UK","creator_description":"My name is Beth Gregory, a Cornish pixie living in Wales.
