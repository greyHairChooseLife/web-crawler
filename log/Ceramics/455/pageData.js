I first became a mother when I was 23 years old and after my son was born I dedicated my life to him and I put aside all my dreams and hopes to raise him. In 2014, I started working for the Department of education right here in the heart of New York City. I then realized &nbsp;that being with children was always my calling. I started doing paint nights for family and children at a local game arcade center for children and it was a big hit, So I thought to myself why not open my own arts and craft studio solely dedicated to families and children. I’m in a small location in Queens part time and I found an Unbelievable store In the shops at Atlas Park Mall located in Glendale, &nbsp;Queens New York. I spoke to Nina she‘s the real estate property manager for the mall. Theres so much traffic in this mall and the majority of the people that visit this mall in particular are famalies with thier children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I’ve figured everything I need from tables to ceramics to canvases ,acrylic paint, tables table covers, chairs ,wall art, I dont need alot of capital to get this project off the ground. Im 100% invested into this project. My goal is to have weekly workshops, art classes, open art studio for cermaic painting and family/children Paint nights and Canvas Birthday parties for children of all ages. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>You might be asking yourself how I came up with this idea, I kept finding myself going out to Long Island to do family things with my children whether it was ceramics, painting, pumpkin picking, pumpkin painting just anything having to do with children’s events &amp;family events.I kept finding myself going out east and nothing right here in my community where there’s thousands and thousands of children’s and families who are looking to do family bonding Activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;There is nothing like what I am talking to you about in this neighborhood or in this vicinity. We will be unique we will be different.</p>\n<p>I will also make it my business to have free monthly workshops for inner-city children who are from low &nbsp;income homes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I will not disappoint you, I’m a fighter, I’m a mother and I am hungry!There is no room in my life to fail!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All I need is people like you to believe in me and to help me make my dreams come true. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Bees-Arts-and-Crafts-Studio-122294309164993/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/Bees-Arts-and-Crafts-Studio-122294309164993/</a>&nbsp;</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">With anything you do in life there’s a always a risk.
