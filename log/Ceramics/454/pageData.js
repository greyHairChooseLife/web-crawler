This fondness has vexed itself into my ceramic work and has created living art. It emulates nature and the spirit of life around us. I work to create art that appears effortless, encompasses inherent movement, and depth beyond its basic function.\r\nMy work is often categorized as rustic, aged and abstract. But I like to think that my art holds a mirror to reveal hidden flaws that are beautiful in all their imperfections. I create art that holds true to the idea that we are not perfect, and that in our textured life, however rough, course and misshapen, our beauty, our true character is revealed and adorned.  \r\nEvery time I sit down at the wheel, pull up to my worktable, I have an idea of what I am trying to create but I try not to always force my expectations on my work. I like to balance my intentions with the intention of the clay. Some days the clay is just not in agreement with what I would like to create, so I keep my ideas and guidelines soft and pliable, ready to be altered.\r\n\r\nBio\r\nDelores J. Hayes is a native of Durham NC. Delores attended North Carolina Central University, Majored in English Lit and Minored in Art. Since her graduation in 2013 she has spent most of her time focusing on developing her style as a ceramic artist. Delores is continuing her ceramic studies at Claymakers as an Assistant. Her work has been featured at North Carolina Central University's Art Museum, in concert collaboration with Lenora Helm Hammonds, and at The ArtsCenter.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Delores Juanita Hayes","creator_last_login":1611273701,"creator_connected_to_facebook":true,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":3,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":1,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"http://deloresjhayes.com","domain":"deloresjhayes.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/414/918/da7e7fb7d0bfe47a945d84d289adbf64_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461593504&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=c422157bca6051ad4f10e05b0917573f","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/2083869767","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Me...Doing what I Love\" data-caption=\"Me...Doing what I Love\" data-id=\"3248313\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Me...Doing what I Love\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/248/313/bcb83a4b8e06a30b91c0716b0800b2cf_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1423328018&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=828f546800e0f4804a424d094cdf32f5\" data-airgap-id=\"22\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Me...Doing what I Love</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"text-center clip mb5\"><div class=\"my-6\"><div class=\"embedly-card\"><div class=\"embedly-card-hug\" style=\"width: 100%; padding: 0px; position: relative; min-width: 200px; margin: 5px auto;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" id=\"emb_85kqet\" class=\"embedly-card\" style=\"border: none; position: relative; visibility: visible; display: block; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%; min-width: 200px;\" height=\"177\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div></div></div></div>\n\n\n<p>I've always seen my self as an artist even as a kid. I vividly remember making dirt burgers and cooking them in the sun, using the small rocks and grass for seasoning :) . For a while I dreamed that I would be a famous singer touring the world. (I still do depending on the day :) Then I wanted to become a writer and tell the world stories of wonder. I used to keep a note book of poems and short stories to show my friends in high-school. I majored in English Lit in college but I fount myself painting to relieve stress. I thought I had found my calling. I was going to be the next Van Gogh. Unfortunately my abstract grey paintings weren't really all that fantastic but they were enough to get me to major in Sudio Art. My first class, ceramics. Everything finally made sense! Why didn't I think of this before?! For me, ceramics has a perfect balance of messiness with structure and such a strong connection to the nature around it.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"http://www.nccu.edu/news/index.cfm?id=244B56D1-F02D-89DB-70AC749D53B19EFF\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Final piece form my very first Ceramic class\" data-caption=\"Final piece form my very first Ceramic class\" data-id=\"3248316\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Final piece form my very first Ceramic class\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/248/316/98db7079616c5db493081830b141469e_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1423328062&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=d35a3195d6faceaf142ecf0888b260d1\" data-airgap-id=\"23\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Final piece form my very first Ceramic class</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a><p>It is almost four years later and I am constructing my art into a career, but dreams are not cheap!&nbsp;My work at this point is scattered. I'm trying my hand at all different types of forms sculptures and glazes. I want to\ndeclutter and pull out the forms that resonate with me.&nbsp;</p><p>This Project will focus on form, texture and colors. I have witnessed pieces that have the right combination of form that appears effortless but full of questioning tension. For me, It's all about the connection, the conversation we may have with other people. My art is not entirely about me and my journey, fears, and triumphs. Its about how that connects me to other people. My art is my form of communication and it needs refining.</p><p>In the words of my friend Andrew Berinson “Art is like a really high level of empathy.” I want to create art that reflects that. I want to create art that causes pause and makes you think about what you're feeling and causes you to question how the person next to you is reacting. Do they feel the same as you? And if so, have you discovered another way to connect to other people, through art? </p>\n\n<p>This kickstarter will finance the exploration and production of my new ceramic work. This is a 3-4 month project starting after the 45 day kickstarter campaign, March 27th, ending in early July. My plan is to use this project to&nbsp;create and develop my voice and style through exploring&nbsp;form, texture and colors.&nbsp;And although I want to focus all my energy on building my art form, a strong foundation for myself as a business must be attended to as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The creation of most of the work will take place at Claymakers which is located Downtown Durham. I've been working here as an assistant for almost 3 years. I've gained so much experience and knowledge from&nbsp;helping to maintain a safe and working studio and also through,&nbsp;workshops and classes with artists such as Eric Serritella, Alan Bennett, Caroly Van Duyn, Charlie Evergreen &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a href=\"http://www.claymakers.org\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Claymakers\" data-caption=\"Claymakers\" data-id=\"3248749\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Claymakers\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/248/749/22aae892275ac0c57894fe3956616d9b_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1423334283&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=a1dc4548a071b5d3f8230c19703aec17\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Claymakers</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a><p>By the end of the project I want to: &nbsp;</p><ul>\n<li>Have 6 solid forms that I will continue to expand upon</li>\n<li>Have cohesive&nbsp;work for a&nbsp;gallery showcase.</li>\n<li>Work for art shows</li>\n<li>Professional photos to be used in graduate, gallery, and Art Show applications</li>\n<li>And an idea of what it truly feels like to produce without the constant stress of where my next bag of clay is coming from</li>\n</ul><p>This Project will allow me to create and share with you and the community without worry, stress, or limits.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Exploration!\" data-caption=\"Exploration!\" data-id=\"3248385\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Exploration!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/248/385/1ccfa02114443c7534b9c68fe0dd636b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1423329291&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b86836bcce8d32eab1a5deb04d587def\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Exploration!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"New glaze experiments!\" data-caption=\"New glaze experiments!\" data-id=\"3248403\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"New glaze experiments!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/248/403/a9ba0ee2222c369884a7ffd1f2a7bf36_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1423329670&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=6904a8c0517ddb912ffb755f14a21e83\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">New glaze experiments!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I will be doing a variety of kiln firings to hone in on what atmospheric firing works best for my work and style.</p><p>This Project will include:</p><ul>\n<li>Gas Reduction firing (A gas fueled firing in which we starve the fire of oxygen to alter the glazes)</li>\n<li>Electric Oxidation&nbsp;Firing (An oxygen rich firing heated with metal coils and produces a more consistent result)</li>\n<li>Raku Firing (A traditional Japanese firing in where you take out your piece when it reaches 1800 degrees and smother it with various combustible materials to alter the glazes.
