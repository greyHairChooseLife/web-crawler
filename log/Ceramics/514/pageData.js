These beautifully illustrated and highly collectable pieces make brilliant talking points, as well as adding a touch of elegance to your own drinks and meals, time after time.</p>\n<p>The detailed illustrations, style, originality and eccentricity makes these mugs a great gift for lovers of Scotland and her Wildlife, or indeed for anyone with a bright imagination and a love of both silliness and sophistication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These clever designs are the brainchild of Trevor &amp; Faye Yerbury, they have been wonderfully brought to life by their friend and artist Christiane Coxon, who Trevor &amp; Faye commissioned to create the artwork. The first 6 designs are totally unique and to enhance this we have sourced the finest bone china mugs, which are made in the UK, with each mug being screen printed and hand finished by the clever ladies at Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire. We’re proud to work with incredibly talented people to create utterly charming and whimsical tableware which can be purchased as a set or mixed and matched with your favourite characters.</p>\n<p>Knowing exactly where our products are made, what they are made from and who makes them is extremely important to us. We have worked tirelessly to find the very best UK manufacturers, visiting and working closely with one of the finest producers of bone china.</p>\n<p>Each mug will have the full image on one side, while on the opposite side we have the head and shoulders. The title of each character is on the inside of the lip of the mug and we have also placed a small Scottish saltire flag on the bottom of the handle.</p>\n<p>Enjoy a sophisticated sip from these collectable mugs, based on native Scottish animals and birds. Perfect for cocoa at bedtime, tea and coffee breaks on busy days or even for some delicious soup-slurping!</p>\n<p>Backers on Kickstarter will be the first to receive these unique bone china mugs before they are generally available and at a very special price of £15. They will retail afterwards at £20.</p>\n<p>We will have a further series of characters available later this year, and as supporters, you will be the first to receive advance notice of availability, as well as early notice of other products we may launch in the future.</p>\n<p>These beautifully crafted mugs (84mm x 89mm) are dishwasher and microwave safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Orders will be shipped in presentation gift boxes and packaged in recyclable cardboard boxes specifically designed for mailing mugs.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"26009226\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/009/226/e3f0e7102824b216be5ef26345ba7966_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564739967&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=5a67bfc30de0b807a70193cb3043a2a2\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"26009239\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/009/239/9aca9b453b2a0fee379b395ece556298_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564740067&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e04ac6c755f2a651a6ef9e46aed7a949\" data-airgap-id=\"28\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"26009245\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/009/245/b17f4ae9f1bfb8f61922361216316764_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564740207&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=1c3788a0511f6b3596a3f769ec6c9882\" data-airgap-id=\"29\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"26009274\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/009/274/af41471e5f1becc35f558cd4acd40a10_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564740516&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=301f9c6e35fd2265179ec405cdce3505\" data-airgap-id=\"30\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"26009282\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/009/282/bb5e80d5286ba13259315913c901d037_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564740573&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4a14d6493e34bb2fbf931773b47a861c\" data-airgap-id=\"31\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"26009268\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/009/268/a7f0b4fb8ebff03789367358e4c135a7_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564740426&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9b40cff3d1770409361dd7e7ce2d798e\" data-airgap-id=\"32\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">We have already visited the factory in Stoke on Trent several times, and have spent time with the design team creating the ideal mugs for us.
