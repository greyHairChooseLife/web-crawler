As a fully stocked, fully functioning ceramics studio on wheels, we will be able to bring pottery classes to schools, events, makers fairs and more!</p><p>Here's why <i>The Curious Clay Society, </i>A Mobile Arts Education Studio makes sense:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<span class=\"bold\">FULL STEAM AHEAD!</span> Art and design in schools is essential and many schools are actively recognizing the need to turn STEM education into STEAM education. Ceramics in particular is a&nbsp;design based problem-solving activity, which involves requiring children to engage in an understanding of the three dimensional world. Children are able to learn, explore, problem solve and create all under the guise of ‘just having fun!’&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"bold\">WHY CERAMICS?</span> Uniquely, ceramics has myriad proven therapeutic applications, all beneficial for the classroom. Ceramics classes have been proven to promote a sense of calmness, slows blood pressure and heart rate, eases depression and bipolar disorders, builds cognitive, emotional, social and physical fitness, and is greatly beneficial for all students on the autism spectrum because of it’s soothing sensory stimulation, which matures childrens' sensory development and motor skills.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"bold\">IT MAKES GOOD MONEY SENSE!</span> Schools have, if any, extremely modest budgets for the visual arts. Most schools rely upon a 'one-size-fits-all' arts program, purchased as modules, and limited only to 2Dimensional art activities. By bringing the field trip to schools, <i>The Curious Clay Society </i>brings 3Dimensional art lessons to life right to a child's classroom! <i>The Curious Clay Society</i> will also partner with local non-profits with existing field trip programs to offer 'paired field trips' to maximize the schools existing scheduling! Imagine, for example, visiting a nature center, then creating a ceramic animal based on your field studies! Or visiting the art museum and applying what you learned to making your own art masterpiece!&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"bold\">EVENTS! </span>Arts education doesn't end after school lets out! When not bringing arts education to schools, <i>The Curious Clay Society </i>will be available to book for private lessons and events such as birthday parties, office retreats, bachelorette parties and 'Sip and Throw' events.</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"bold\">MAKERS FAIRS: </span>In addition to being arts educators, we at <i>The Curious Clay Society</i> are working artists and will be involved in local makers fairs and festivals. Bringing demos to the public, selling work and offering mini-lessons will be another revenue stream allowing us to keep our prices to schools low and reflects our commitment to bringing arts education to the public.</li>\n</ul><h1 id=\"h:about-the-rewards\" class=\"page-anchor\"><span class=\"bold\">About the Rewards!</span></h1><p>In addition to supporting arts education within schools and the community, each pledged donation will receive a handmade ceramic work of art, a private ceramics lesson or a custom party!&nbsp;</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\"

The challenge of this project is that many schools have just recently brought back art programming and only have a very limited financial budget.
