Yes, one could easily go to Walmart and purchase a cereal bowl or a cup-- very cheaply and oh so easily without any bit of thought or real effort, but knowing that this item was actually created with thought, hours of work and sacrifice, sweat (and sometimes tears), and especially love-- all by another human soul whose livelihood and happiness depends on his efforts and his craft.\" Emily Crofts</p><p>\"I have purchased more than a dozen mugs, bowls, vases, and pitchers from Norris. His craftsmanship and attention to detail are exquisite, and each piece is unique and beautiful. When he says that his mug will become your favorite, this is not hyperbole. I open my cupboards looking for my favorite bowls and mugs because they just have the right feel, weight, color, texture, and design that make them personal and valuable to me in a way that nothing commercially purchased ever could. I have been slowly phasing out my brand-name stuff and replacing it with Norris's handcrafted work over the past couple years, and never have had a moment's regret.
