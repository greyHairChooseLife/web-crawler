If you have not received it yet, please know that it is coming and in the process of making!</p><p>Thanks to you, I was able to complete the build out of the gas kiln! Unexpected expenses of that building process took up all of the funds from the Kickstarter campaign! With little left for shipping, I have been hand delivering a lot of the rewards.  For those of you who have items needing to be shipped, we now have packaging supplies and will send those out as soon as possible! I am very sorry for the delay.  The positive side is that a lot of the local community supported BRICK's project for which I am so very thankful for.  Please know that the rewards will get to you and if you need a rush on an item feel free to contact me via message or email brickceramics@gmail.com or by my cell phone (216)-744-4689. </p><p>Since the Kickstarter, I have mastered the firing process of the gas kiln and have developed the proper glaze recipes for your rewards!  BRICK now has 7 studio members and a regular class schedule.  Friday March 4th, marked the end of construction and the grand opening of BRICK Gallery! Also on that day, a local coffee shop, Six Shooter Coffee, had its grand opening in the same building as BRICK's gallery space! Come visit the space and feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"5554026\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/554/026/4a4f2c66010ca8f343f2b610f4c90fbf_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1458313334&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=07f5ec67b08b9273912001862484de48\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>Thank you so much for supporting the start up of BRICK! </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Val Grossman, Owner, BRICK Ceramic + Design Studio </p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1438094154,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTEzMDcyMDE=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Update!","publishedAt":1438094154,"pinnedAt":null,"number":6,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"BRICK Ceramic + Design Studio","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/554/727/53aaa2fbb84b473163bb6e023e868742_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461602875&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=b02a0f58aae32632da1036e5f94ea049","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":7,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Hello Kickstarter supporters!

The gas kiln has cost us in total $15,000 to build, vent, plumb, and ensure safety features.\nWe are excited to share this tool with many ceramic artists and provide a source for high temperature firing.
