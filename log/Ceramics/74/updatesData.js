This then gives you different glaze colours and effects to an oxidised firing (like you get in a standard electric kiln) like copper reds (copper usually gives a green colour). ¬†This process also turns any clay that is unglazed a dark, matt black as it absorbs the carbon as the material burns. This is how crackle glazes get the cracks tinted black too.</p>\n<p>You can brush things against the piece while it's hot and it will mark the surface with the carbon or other colour from whatever you chose. ¬†Most common are things like feather, horse hair or dried plants. This can give some really interesting patterns and marks depending on what you use. Although it doesn't have quite the same spectacular impact for anyone watching it has a magic of its own.</p>\n<p>Pieces can then be speed cooled in water but this isn't necessary for every finish. ¬†It's a good idea if you have a good reduction in the glaze as it will 'fix' the glaze so that there isn't time for oxidation to change it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I don't have any photos from 15 years ago as they were all saved on cds in a format I can no longer open :( The only photo I have is of the masks on the project page but there is so much more that can be achieved with raku finishes, including some absolutely gorgeous effects that can be achieved no other way...but that's for tomorrow's update! ;)</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1595532171,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI5MDIzMTA=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"Halfway there with 7 days to go!","publishedAt":1595532171,"pinnedAt":null,"number":3,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Paula Bond","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/487/585/f411921890997c7234a0e76bcf0547d1_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1592319102&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=58f6336ee479e921ba5eba12bad6cd63","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":4,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>Thank you all so much for your support. ¬†We've made it past the halfway point!
