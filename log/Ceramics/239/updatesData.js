Because of you, we will be able to buy 10 pottery wheels, a big new kiln, and more shelves than we ever thought we would buy in a lifetime. Our beautiful little dream is starting to become a reality and we couldn’t have done it without your generosity!</p>\n<br>\n<p>We are launching our long term wheel throwing classes later this week. If you pledged $250 or more, you will get the earliest access to our class sign ups starting THURSDAY, June 10th, at 11am CST. There are four sessions to choose from (Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays) that will meet over the course of 6 weeks. Each session only has 10 spots available so we have a feeling they will fill up quickly. We will email you all with a password which will give you early access - we ask that you please keep this password to yourself. Folks who have signed up for our email list will get access the following day (Friday, June 11th) and then class sign-ups will be open to the general public on Saturday at 10am CST.</p>\n<p>We’re also still in the process of filling our calendar with one-off / weekend workshops! Those will likely be posted in a week or two so stay tuned for those.</p>\n<br>\n<p>The rest of our reward merch will be rolling out soon! We have the incredible Corey Carbo on board and she has created some incredible illustrations for us. We are putting the finishing touches on those and will share them with you very soon!</p>\n<br>\n<p>Thanks again for helping us bring the Club House to life! We are so excited to build a space for you all to come and learn some new skills and meet your new best friends :)</p>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1622990657,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"25000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"25075.33","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":207,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"launch","timestamp":1620398658,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"25000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"25075.33","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":207,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"}]
