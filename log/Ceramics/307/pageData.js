The kiln requires no special gas\nlines, no permits, and is easily portable to any job site, special\nevent or for teaching purposes. \n</p>\n\n<p>This kiln is capable of a full\n'reduction', full 'oxidation' or any desired atmosphere in between.\nCooling time can be as little as 6-7 hours from a cone 10 firing .\nWhich would make it possible to fire to cone 10 every 8 hours, up to\n3 Times a Day. \n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<p>This is a Labor of Love 'by and for'\n\tthe Ceramic Community. \n\t</p>\n<li>\n<p>The design is based in part on a\n\tKiln Design by the late Frank Ross of Deer Island Maine, where it\n\twas a slightly different shape, made of Hard Firebrick and took\n\tabout 4-5 hours to reach cone 10. \n\t</p>\n\t\n\t</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then in the 1970's he graciously\n\tshared his design with my Mentor, Michael J. Frimkess (at\n\tthat time, using a 'less' efficient kiln given to him by the great\n\tMichael Cardew) and encouraged him to work towards improving its\n\tefficiency for the sake of fuel conservation, which he did, \n\t</p>\n\t\n\t</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then decades later in 1992, after\n\tgreat improvement upon the previous design, Michael Frimkess in turn\n\tshared his subsequent advances with me, and encouraged me to\n\texperiment with the design and improve its efficiency and\n\taccessibility if possible, which I did</p>\n\t\n\t</li>\n<li>\n<p>I have improved upon the previous\n\tdesign by making it 1.lighter (with the use of bio-soluble non ceramic refractory fiber) and 2.portable (by making the necessary adjustments to accommodate the use of propane instead of natural gas)   and I am proposing to make the current 3rd Generation\n\t'Power-Draft Kiln' available commercially for the introductory price\n\tof about $5000</p>\n\t\n\t\n</li>\n</ul></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I seem to have run into 'several' challenges and risks over the years.\r\n\r\nOne challenge seems to be introducing 'unknown' technology and processes into a field with such social connotations. Alot of people in the world of Studio Ceramics tend to support their local teachers unconditionally like Heroes as if Pottery Throwing and Firing depended more on Style and Philosophy than Skill and Physics. \r\n\r\nMy throwing and firing work is not possible for most Ceramics Teachers that I've met, so apparently it has been collectively dismissed as a 'new trick', when actually it is based on Ancient Methods employed by the Chinese and Koreans, as they were the first groups to consistently produce Eggshell Thin Porcelain Ware that was Fully Vitrified long before anyone in Europe or America.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem I've become aware of is outright 'Piracy'..but this Technology is'nt easy to steal, it would have to be deliberately given, which is what I'm trying to do now.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":5,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 20</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>As a reward for your $20 pledge, I will make a video thanking you, in which I will throw you a small vase, teacup or bowl.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-09-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Sep 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n2 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 50</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 50</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>REWARDS\n<br>As a reward for your $50 pledge, I will make a video thanking you, in which I will throw you a 3lb.
