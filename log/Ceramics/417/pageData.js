I have many ideas as to how I could add value and diversify the basic business, making art and ceramic parties, workshops and after-school activities available and affordable locally. I have 6yr-old twins, and I know what they love and how hard it can be to find affordable enriching activities in the area.</p><p>I'd like to offer moms with little ones a unique space so they can bring them along too, allowing them to socialise and get messy at the same time.</p><p>I plan to offer holiday workshops where kids and adults alike can learn new skills, such as silk-screening and pottery throwing on a wheel.
