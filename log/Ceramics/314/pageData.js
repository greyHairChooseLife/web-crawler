We also want for our student body to be able to enjoy the artwork and make them want to explore art further by maybe taking an art class themselves.</p><p>We want to do a homage to Jackson Pollock.&nbsp; We have used Jackson Pollock's method of pouring paint on top of 4 inch tiles.&nbsp; Kiln paint now is so advanced that you can actually layer one color over another something impossible in the past.</p><p>We have created a mini piece that is pictured in our project page here. We want to turn this prototype into a 6 ft x 4 ft piece on sanded and stained oak, that we intend to wood burn the same type of design into.</p><p>The money goes for 2 boxes of 100&nbsp;4 inch square ceramic tiles, ceramic paint, wood stain and wood and wood burning tools, mounting apparatus. This will also cover adhesive and grout supplies plus the lights for the piece.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">We don't expect any problems and hope to be done in May.
