I want to start Homemade Ceramics so that I can explore my abilities further and in new ways that I was unable to try in my ceramics classes. The funds that I get from this will go to buying a throwing wheel, clay, and the necessary equipment to make a small kiln. The works that I'll create will combine old style firing techniques that are commonly used for more traditional ceramics such as pots and vases, but will use more modern ceramic forms and sculptures. </p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The risks that come with this project is that to my knowledge no one has tried to experimentally fire non-traditional pottery and ceramics in a traditional style firing. The results of what will happen to my work is unknown this entire project is shrouded in mystery, but that is why I feel so strongly about doing it and creating new and unique art that I hope others will appreciate.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":1,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 20</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 20</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>People who help with the project will receive a unique gift of the ceramic sculpts that will be made from the first few firings.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2017-12-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Dec 2017</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>"],"number_of_FAQ":"0","number_of_updates":"0","number_of_comments_depth_all":"0","contents_of_FAQ":[],"last_updated":"February 29, 2016"}
