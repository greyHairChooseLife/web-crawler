Many requests have been for high school senior projects. I have not yet charged anything for lessons and have invested in a second pottery wheel so that I can keep some production going while teaching others. New learners tend to produce a number of crashed pots which could be recycled with the acquisition of a pug mill. A new Peter Pugger mill with a stand costs $4738, the goal amount. Should more be raised or a good used pug mill be found, excess funds will go toward a third wheel and a kiln for student work, along with clay and glaze materials.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"2964308\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/964/308/0bdb57e38d5df88c1b7ccf2c330f0f5e_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1416871075&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4227f19fdc725439526c14c804bdff63\" data-airgap-id=\"27\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:thank-you-for-your-h\" class=\"page-anchor\">Thank you for your help!</h1><p>And a special thanks to everyone who has supported my pottery business so far.

One major challenge that I have until I am able to purchase a pugmill is storing all of the unusable old clay while continuing to purchase new clay. Putting the used clay in a landfill is not an environmentally sound recycling method. I am determined to find places to store old clay until I am able to restore it to a usable state with a pugmill.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":1,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 100</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 100</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>For the first 20 who donate $100 or more will receive a Lonesome Pine Pottery spoon rest.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2015-02-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Feb 2015</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Only United States</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-celebrate-100\">\nLimited (20 left of 20)\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>"],"number_of_FAQ":"0","number_of_updates":"0","number_of_comments_depth_all":"0","contents_of_FAQ":[],"last_updated":"December 26, 2014"}
