I just want to let my backers know that all of your pieces have been made and are expected to be bisque fired within the next week. I am hoping to have your pieces out by the end of the month. I apologize for the delay! Here's what's been going on with the kiln:</p>\n<p>Electrical work took longer than expected! I decided to install the kiln in our shed out back, instead of in our house. This decision took a little more work, but was the best decision in the end. I completed a test firing in my kiln a couple days ago, but the bottom of the kiln seemed a little cool compared to the rest, so I am completing another test firing as we speak! These take 8 hours from start to finish and I can't open the kiln until the next morning because it's way too hot. A bisque firing (what I'm test firing at) gets to 1950 degrees, so you can imagine it takes a long time for it to be cool enough to touch. </p>\n<p>If all goes well with this test firing, I will be loading Kickstarter rewards on Wednesday! After they are bisque fired, that means the clay is vitrified and is stronger. That's when I apply the glazes to the pieces! After the glaze is applied, back into the kiln they go! The second firing will get to about 2200 degrees. After that is complete, your pieces will be ready to be shipped!</p>\n<p>I hope y'all learned something new about ceramics with this post! A lot of time and love is going into creating these pieces and I appreciate your patience! I will update you all as the process moves along.
