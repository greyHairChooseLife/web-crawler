It's been a great mix of full-on work schedules and moments of sweet quiet around the neighborhood. We're loving the mid-August sky and all the sights and sounds of Summer's golden hours.</p><p>Our colossal project is moving along. Most of the electrical wiring has been installed and we're getting close to inviting the drywall expert to join in the fun. I'm hoping to move the studio sometime in the fall. The second story -- apartment and guest bunks -- will be finished sometime this winter. I'm hoping to schedule workshops for next year this winter and spring, so if you have ideas i.e., specific potters and/or other inspiring figures, please share them. I'm open to ideas for use of the guest spaces, too; I think the little kitchen will be a sweet spot for small gatherings such as writing groups, corporate retreats, etc. Have an idea? Bring it on.</p><p>On the schedule:</p><p>September 3</p><p>Labor Day Potluck and Kickstarter reward pick up!</p><p>We're partying down up on Mason Hill! Come jump in the silo pool, share some food, and pick up your Kickstarter reward. </p><p>You didn't participate in the studio kickstarter? No problem! Come anyhow and see the in-progress studio space.</p><p>Can't make the party but are dying for your reward? I'll be delivering in September if you live in a 25 mile radius, or I'll be shipping all the other grateful pieces to you wherever you are. *If you haven't, PLEASE SEND ME YOUR MAILING ADDRESS so I can ship your reward to you**</p><p>Bring a dish to share and your bathing suit if you fancy a very cold dip.  </p><p>*RSVP by August 28.

If you know us at all, you know we're are DIYers. We've renovated three houses. We aren't strangers to the idea of self-sufficiency and we've enjoyed the benefits and satisfaction that comes with getting things done on our own. So, the idea of calling on others to help was a slight stretch for me. </p><p>What pushed me forward in thinking about crowdfunding the studio? Well, a number of things. For one, I was motivated to share the idea. I was motivated to share the idea and the project because, over the last few years, as teaching became a regular part of my practice again, it became clear that people wanted to know more about what goes on in the studio from day to day. How are the pots they're buying made? Who makes the clay and glazes I use? Who runs the business side of things? i realized with great joy that people want to be a part of something creative and that sharing the whole picture is actually giving something back. And if folks can't be a part of the actual studio practice they might like to be a part of things in other ways - coming to potlucks, house concerts, bartering projects, for walks. I found I wanted to share the space and beautiful surroundings almost as much as I wanted to teach.  </p><p>I started talking with other people who have corwdfunded and I was surprised at their motivation, mostly because raising money wasn't always their first goal - involving the community was. This floated my boat.</p><p>During that time, I was also inspired by Amanda Palmer's book: <b>The Art of Asking</b>. Her TEDTalk is a short version. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking?language=en#t-295456\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> and see how this very edgy artist came to understand the significance of asking for help and its meaning beyond receiving money.</p><p>As we enter the home stretch of the campaign, we want to thank everyone who's contributed and ask that you continue to share the project with everyone you know. We are so excited to have you here with us on this adventure.</p><p>Please come visit.
