I operate a small teaching studio in Hallowell, Maine called Hallowell Clay Works. I also teach at the University of Maine at Augusta, Watershed Center for the Ceramic Arts in Newcastle and The Maine Arts Commission statewide K-12. I am passionate about locally sourced Glacial marine clay.\r\n\r\nClay is my modality for healing trauma and empowering others to gain trust in their own creative abilities. My teaching approach is “Let yourself be terrible at this while you learn”.","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Maryalice Weber","creator_last_login":1667002877,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":2,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[{"url":"https://www.kennebecclay.com","domain":"kennebecclay.com"},{"url":"https://www.malleyweber.com","domain":"malleyweber.com"}],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/039/016/013/3d788dfa983532c842b4326b9d926257_original.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1666651343&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=7274fddf2da409461e3074c2437b48ce","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/kennebecclay","days_to_go":"25","all_or_nothing":true,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Our community clay studio has purchased a new building.</span> <span class=\"bold\">We are excited to increase our class offerings.

So much of what we are trying to accomplish involves skilled labor and we all know there is a shortage and the building industry has exploded. We have small jobs so we are hoping that someone can sneak us in between the cracks. As artists we are fairly handy, so the best case scenario is we do as much of the unskilled labor and bring in the big guys when we need to. We may have some delays, but we are flexible and can find creative solutions. There will also be the challenge of juggling 2 spaces.  We are planning on keeping the rental space in Hallowell and rebuilding the gallery for shows, sales, and special events. We’ve just hired 2 new people to help manage the day to day so that Malley can manage the big shifts.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":7,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge without a reward\n</h2>\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pledge__title\">\nThe Earthenware Club\n</h3>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>A huge thanks for your donation!
