With that, I thank you for the support!\n———————————————————————\nI do have news that there have been changes made to the rewards and that there may be a delay shipping due to my affiliation with the military (at the latest, mid-November). I am deeply saddened about this delay, but I wanted to make things up to all of you. So please keep reading for more positive additions made to the rewards!\n———————————————————————\nFirstly, the mugs are coming along great with no issue (other than the time needed) and need to be fired two more times to ensure they’re glazed and ready to ship!\n———————————————————————\n(Please note that the color in the attached photo is not the final tone of the mugs and will become darker and glossier through being fired in the kiln)\n———————————————————————\nAttached is a photo of the gear you will be receiving with your mugs (will cast based on the rewards you had chosen) and you may have noticed a little change that may be puzzling. It’s no mistake; everyone will be receiving a puzzle of my art!\n———————————————————————\nReason being is that the intended “Witch Swizzle Stick” was not the best quality for you and I had to make a choice to set things right. Along with that, everyone will be receiving the Shaman Skull Swizzle Sticks, gold umbrellas, bendy straws and a cocktail recipe card!\n———————————————————————\nIf there are any questions or concerns please contact me via here on Kickstarter, email (tikistavern@gmail.com), or Instagram (@tavern_tikis). I will be more than happy to hear from my supporters!\n———————————————————————\n-TIKI’S TAVERN</p>","nativeImages":[{"id":"SW1hZ2UtNDE4MjYz","url":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/4000838/posts/2989646/image-418263-original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=560&v=1602960861&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=fb7bc66d54069210dd794d8b71cb2699","__typename":"Image"}],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1601183191,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTI5NjcxMTg=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"The Rare Trio is in production!","publishedAt":1601183191,"pinnedAt":null,"number":7,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"Christopher Baganha","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/missing_user_avatar.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=f59fbc667bd2955360201f24253383dd","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"body":"<p>The 3D Print is complete and wow it’s a big one!
