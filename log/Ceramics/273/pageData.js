I loved doodling and drawing, playing with modeling clay, painting. Art was my favorite subject. Any time we had a field trip to the art museum I was in Heaven. When I entered High School, they offered ceramics, and I jumped at the chance. That teacher was and still is my favorite teacher I ever had. She taught me so much! And expanded my love for the art. I knew from then on I wanted to be a sculptor, ceramicist, potter, and just get down and dirty in my artwork. I attended college for art, but didn't finish. That's a long and painful chapter in my life... Fast forward to the present. I am a mom of four, drive a school bus, and have a wonderful, hardworking husband who supports my lifelong dream.</p><p>My dream and the reason for this Kickstarter is to build a ceramics studio in my backyard. I am intending to buy a pre-built, Amish made cabin to convert into a backyard studio. With the remaining funds, I wish to buy plenty of supplies to bring ceramics back to the small community I live in. The high school doesn't offer ceramics, the middle school does a small lesson session on it, but I want to build a studio so anyone with the desire to learn and create can come and make a work of art.</p><p> I also need studio space for my own aspirations. I want to create works of art that feature our school mascot, the falcon. I then want to donate these works of art to select local businesses in town, along with business cards for my studio. I also want to create custom orders and for every order, I plan to donate some of the money earned back to the school's art departments so the middle school can continue to offer ceramics. Once I’m established, I am thrilled to offer sessions for people to come in and create their own works of art for a nominal fee. That fee would include 5lbs. of clay, ALL supplies, glazes, return visits, and the firings. I’m thinking $20 per creation. I have talked to some students and friends in my community and this is something that is garnering lots of interest.</p><p>I have talked to members of a local art gallery and I have been invited to display and sell works of art through their co-op in exchange for volunteer hours. There is another gallery in the opposite direction that I will soon become a member of. </p><p>This is truly my lifelong dream and I really hope with the help of some wonderful people that it can finally come to fruition. Thank you for taking the time to look at my page.</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">I have already talked to my town code clerk about permits and I do not need one for now. I would like to think I have covered all of my bases. The one thing I may have trouble with is my kiln location. I need the wire ran and am in talks with getting it done. I'm going to a studio to see if they can recommend someone. In the event I have a kiln-tastrophe, I have gotten permission to use the kiln at the middle school. I can see the school from my house, so distance is not a factor. My husband is also looking into building me a cinderblock shed next to the studio. As of right now, my kiln is on my porch.</p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"ksr-green-700 bold type-16\" href=\"/help/hc/sections/115001107133\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a></div>","number_of_support_options":6,"contents_of_support_options":["<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 5</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 5</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Handwritten thank you note and the satisfaction of helping someone live their lifelong dream.</p>\n\n<a class=\"pledge__reward-description-toggle js-desc-toggle hide\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n<span>Less</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__extra-info\">\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Estimated delivery</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\"><time datetime=\"2016-08-01\" data-format=\"MMM YYYY\" class=\"js-adjust-time\">Aug 2016</time></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__detail\">\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-label\">Ships to</span>\n<span class=\"pledge__detail-info\">Anywhere in the world</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pledge__backer-stats\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap\">\n<div class=\"mr1 mb1\">\n<div class=\"text-nowrap type-12 support-500 radius6px px2 py4px bg-support-100\">\n0 backers\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>","<div class=\"pledge__info\">\n<h2 class=\"pledge__amount\">\nPledge <span class=\"money\">US$ 15</span> or more\n<span class=\"pledge__currency-conversion\">\nAbout <span>US$ 15</span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"pledge__reward-description pledge__reward-description--expanded\">\n<p>Handwritten thank you note and a picture of the finished studio.
