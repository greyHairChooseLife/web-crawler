Many of you have sent your photos and I was able to draw them on some of the ring dishes and coasters already! A few of your pets are here! Have you found yours? Some others are in the kilns and some are still being worked on.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Wow so amazed at the variety of pets out there! So far I've drawn everything from a beautiful exotic snail to some adorable kittens! A few reptiles and some pups too. All beautiful and amazing creatures! </p>\n<br>\n<p>I made the ceramic ring dishes, fired them and now am drawing your pets and animals on them. Next step is glazing! The glazes look so different when they are first applied. (kind of matte) but once they are fired in the kiln they will have a beautiful shine! </p>\n<br>\n<p> They are foodsafe glazes so you can use them as teabag holders, ring dishes or even as an appetizer dish. Once they are glazed, fingers crossed that everything fires ok! I've shipped out a few already and will give you a tracking number once I send it. </p>\n<br>\n<p>Thank you again!
