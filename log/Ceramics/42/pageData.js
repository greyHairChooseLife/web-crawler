Decker-Smith Pottery was a thriving business until my hiatus in 2008. Now that all of my babies are children, it's time to bring the pottery off of the back burner, and that's where I need your help. </p><p>I am asking for your support to raise $2,425 to fund the following budget:<br>Clay $600<br>Kiln $500<br>220 Extension Cord $75<br>Electricity $500<br>Glaze Materials and other Supplies $500<br>Kickstarter Fees $250</p><p>This is my shoestring budget to get Decker-Smith Pottery off the ground again. With this budget I can get a used kiln from Craigslist and enough clay to get started. If more money is raised, I will use those funds to purchase a better (maybe even new!) kiln, pay studio fees to fire in a gas kiln in a local cooperative studio, buy more clay and glaze supplies and make many more pots!</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Stretch Goals - </span>Any pledges received over the minimum campaign amount ($2,425) will go to fund stretch goals. <br><span class=\"bold\"><br>Stretch Goal 1: $4000 total</span><br>If pledges reach $4000, the extra funds will be used to purchase better equipment (the dream: a NEW kiln), and more clay and other supplies so that Decker-Smith Pottery doesn't just get off the ground - but soars!</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Stretch Goal 2: $6000 total</span><br>If pledges reach $6000, the extra funds will be used to enhance my craft with classes and workshops. Now that I'm returning to my passion after a 6 year hiatus, my appetite for learning all things ceramic is insatiable. I want to know all the new tricks and old techniques and pass that knowledge on to my customers in the form of cool new pots.</p><p>See more of my work here: <a href=\"http://deckersmithpottery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://deckersmithpottery.com/</a></p><a href=\"http://deckersmithpottery.com/wp/pots-for-drink/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Mugs (click photo to see more mugs)\" data-caption=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Mugs (click photo to see more mugs)\" data-id=\"3313220\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Mugs (click photo to see more mugs)\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/313/220/6ed9f20b0ea74c5fa1e01fda0bcf1136_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1424416105&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a364fd4c2f31e537787ef7686cb97ea7\" data-airgap-id=\"24\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Decker-Smith Pottery Mugs (click photo to see more mugs)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a><a href=\"http://deckersmithpottery.com/wp/pots-for-drink/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Pitcher (click photo to see more pitchers)\" data-caption=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Pitcher (click photo to see more pitchers)\" data-id=\"3313223\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Pitcher (click photo to see more pitchers)\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/313/223/ba1c7f97c9c5cb07121fc854a20cdee9_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1424416157&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e8e2cf940677f479edb9734645eb61bd\" data-airgap-id=\"25\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Decker-Smith Pottery Pitcher (click photo to see more pitchers)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a><a href=\"http://deckersmithpottery.com/wp/dsp-tea/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Teapot (click photo to see more teapots)\" data-caption=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Teapot (click photo to see more teapots)\" data-id=\"3313227\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Decker-Smith Pottery Teapot (click photo to see more teapots)\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/313/227/13f2661a6fec8c72f50ec421feb47a4e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1424416199&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=9a1233db8edea7453cff04c7c0759fb5\" data-airgap-id=\"26\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Decker-Smith Pottery Teapot (click photo to see more teapots)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</a></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">There are very few risks to this venture.
