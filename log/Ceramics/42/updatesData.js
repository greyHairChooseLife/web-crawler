It was after midnight Easter morning. I left the wheel and went downstairs to fill some Easter baskets, and when I walked back upstairs past the teapots I had just finished, I got a wild hair and did something crazy. Without over-thinking it, I started cutting their spouts. The DSP teapots of the past all had long trumpet-ish spouts. But in that creative moment I followed my gut and am really happy with the outcome and the new spout possibilities. </p><p>I am looking at things in new ways and following new instincts and loving every minute. Thank you for allowing me to dive back into this passion of mine with both feet! </p>\n<p>As for your rewards, I've been busy busy busy getting them thrown and they will be the first pots fired in the new kiln. I expect them to be in your hands ahead of schedule! </p>\n<p>Happy Spring Everyone!
