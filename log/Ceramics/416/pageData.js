Or a graphic designer. But a friend of mine who claims to be very psychic told me I was Korean in a past life, and I was a potter. That was my true calling, according to her. Skeptically, I went to a group pottery lesson. I was terrible. Worst in the class. After explaining it to my friend, she said, \"You expect to much of yourself. Try again.\" I did. And I got very good very quick. Now, I'm addicted. Victim of suggestion? Maybe. But I can't stop.","creator_verifiedIdentity":null,"creator_last_login":1405389291,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":0,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/008/958/718/22e07667158a68958f78a453f1e327af_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461551662&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=4510cb02ce938876177ea8f4d32f4858","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1878291206","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>I'm a potter. I make pots. And vases. And bowls. And plates. It gives me a sense of Zen-like calm to create. Hours pass like minutes and, if I'm lucky, I have a pile of work when the day is out. However, the studio I belong to only has hours between noon and 6pm... the same time I'm working. So, I'd like to throw clay at home. I have a nice little outdoor space set up where I live to create pots and vases and bowls and plates. All I need is a wheel. And they ain't cheap. </p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\" class=\"mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks\"><div class=\"mobile-show py3\"></div><h3 class=\"normal mb4\">Risks and challenges</h3><p class=\"js-risks-text text-preline\">The only risk and challenge is carrying the wheel up three flights of stairs.
