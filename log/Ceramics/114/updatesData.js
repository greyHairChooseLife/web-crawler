We blew past the stretch goal of $10,000 so every cup ordered will receive a free lid! The last month has been such an amazing experience. I have been super busy trying to keep up with orders as they have been coming in. I have been working nearly every day for the past month. At present, I have finished nearly half the total number of cups and vases. Every piece requires hand finishing so it is a little slow going, but I think it will be worth the wait. :). I should have every piece finished in a little over a month. Next, they all will be shipped to the US together via freighter. Lastly, they will be repackaged and send out to everyone individual.  Those who live outside the US will probably receive them first as they will be sent directly from Thailand. Thank you all so much for being a part of this journey. I will keep everyone updated as the project progresses.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Trevor</p><a href=\"http://facebook.com/trevorjamesfosterart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Follow me on facebook for step-by-step updates :)\" data-caption=\"Follow me on facebook for step-by-step updates :)\" data-id=\"16615491\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Follow me on facebook for step-by-step updates :)\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/615/491/684f86b4494857e077e431c75452b99d_original.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1494433548&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=282fadb807a8b11da456e24aa7ae0440\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Follow me on facebook for step-by-step updates :)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n</a>","nativeImages":[],"__typename":"FreeformPost"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"success","timestamp":1494400158,"data":{"goal":{"currency":"USD","amount":"5000.0","__typename":"Money"},"pledged":{"currency":"USD","amount":"10939.0","__typename":"Money"},"backersCount":152,"__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEvent"},"__typename":"ProjectTimelineEventEdge"},{"node":{"type":"update","timestamp":1491913213,"data":{"id":"RnJlZWZvcm1Qb3N0LTE4NTIyNjU=","type":"FreeformPost","title":"This project was just fully funded!","publishedAt":1491913213,"pinnedAt":null,"number":2,"actions":{"read":true,"pin":false,"__typename":"PostActions"},"author":{"name":"TrevorFosterStudio","imageUrl":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/784/483/e22c59ca07530fb0fef72087b6660be0_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1553007721&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=5249e1775cebd1151724d78ec90586bb","__typename":"User"},"authorRole":"creator","isPublic":true,"likesCount":10,"commentsCount":3,"body":"<h1 id=\"h:woo-hooo\" class=\"page-anchor\">Woo-Hooo!</h1><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/trevorjamesfosterart/\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"WE DID IT!\" data-caption=\"WE DID IT!\" data-id=\"16216365\">\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"WE DID IT!\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/216/365/8ac96173c1f570a9d91bbf83a5cfb574_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1491913138&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=51e70e97c334e0e0edb2fb216eedddac\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">WE DID IT!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p> </p>\n</a><p>Today we just blew past the project goal!
