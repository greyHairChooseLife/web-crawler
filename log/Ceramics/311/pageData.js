(The things we do for our kiddos eh?) So now I'm having to start over and would like to start with buying a good working wheel and small kiln. Used is my preference because we &nbsp;know its good to recycle! So by helping fund me you're also in turn helping someone who needs to sell their stuff, hows that for paying it forward?! :)&nbsp;</p><p>A decent wheel is going to go for about $800 used and &nbsp;medium kiln will run any where from $1200 to $2500, add in another $500 for shelving and posts and miscellaneous cones for firing.</p><p>*and yes pottery on the wheel, just like in the movie \"ghost\" although none of us are quite as sexy as Demi &amp; Patrick when were working on the wheel. Just hope you dont get an irresistible itch on your eyelid or nose...</p><p>Thanks a kiln-load for taking the time to read my story!</p></div></div>","page_of_risks":"<div id=\"risks-and-challenges\"
