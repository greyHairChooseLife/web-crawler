I come from a superbly gifted family, where creativity runs the gamut from quilting to woodworking. Although I have experimented in many different arenas, my particular niche is painting. I mainly work with acrylic and glaze paints on canvas and pottery. In conjunction with my heartfelt passion for art, I am exceptionally driven to start my own business. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Business Administration from Muhlenberg College with a GPA of 3.96, and I have 10 years of professional work experience. Utilizing my right and left brains in synchronicity, I want to inject more color and beauty into the world!!!","creator_verifiedIdentity":"Samantha Schiffert","creator_last_login":1436398546,"creator_connected_to_facebook":false,"creator_number_of_created_project":1,"creator_number_of_backed_project":0,"creator_number_of_collaborators":0,"creator_contents_of_collaborators":[],"creator_number_of_attatched_links":0,"creator_contents_of_attatched_links":[],"creator_image":"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/009/715/348/6f337ed614503d6bd5e1336538ee6e7b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&w=160&h=160&fit=crop&v=1461623213&auto=format&frame=1&q=92&s=8648a79978e425fdcf96be78cfdef33c","creator_url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1223891286","all_or_nothing":false,"page_of_story":"<div class=\"rte__content\"><div><p>Cancer victims know life's struggle all too well.

We must GO WITH THE FLOW!</p><p>For my Mother, and all those fighting cancer, I would like to bring these turtles to life, and set them free into the world to spread awareness and joy!</p><p>The goal of $250 will buy 7 cases of a dozen ceramic turtles at wholesale price (minimum order), as well as a small supply of acrylic paints.
